    "**The requirements of this assignment:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The main goal of this assignment is to use centrality measures to predict (positive or negative) outcomes for a node. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Identify an interesting set of network data that is available on the web (either through web scraping or web APIs) that could be used for analyzing and comparing centrality measures across nodes. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. As an additional constraint, there should be at least one categorical variable available for each node (such as “Male” or “Female”; “Republican”, “Democrat,” or “Undecided”, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### data obtainment \n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment, we will be scrapping Harry Potter data from wikipedia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Harry_Potter_characters). We will also group the characters into good and evil based on the information obtained from the data set scrapped from wiki(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_Eater, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_the_Phoenix_(fictional_organisation))and Harry Porter Wiki(http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Lee_Jordan)\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three data sets: \n",
    "main character names: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YunMai-SPS/DATA620_homework/master/DATA620_homework_2/nodes.csv \n",
    "character relationships: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YunMai-SPS/DATA620_homework/master/DATA620_homework_2/edges.csv\n",
    "affiliation of each character: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YunMai-SPS/DATA620_homework/master/DATA620_homework_2/affiliation.csv\n",
    "\n",
    "The character will be marked as either good or evil based on their affiliations. If a person who was a member of Dumbledore’s Army or acted as Dumbledore’s Army allies, he/she will be a good guy. Similarly, the people who were a signed member of the Order of Phoenix is good even though there were several previous members betray the Order of Phoenix and worked for the villain later.   The Death Eaters are bad guys in the fiction and they will be marked as evil. There are some characters like Muggles, goblins, governors, animals are neither good or bad. We mark them as ambiguous. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Hypothesis: \n",
    "\n",
    "The good and evil will form two groups. The two groups will form two subgraphs surrounding the person with the highest centrality in each group. We will see who are the most influential characters in the fiction. By social network graph, we will be able to see the communities like Weasleys, Dursleys and who are best friends. We will also take a look at Whether the community bridge is the spy? We also anticipate the nodes that belong to more than one group will have higher degree centrality on average than the nodes that belong to only one group.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Approach:\n",
    "\n",
    "The data will be download and the nodes will be affiliation will be assigned to each character to marked them into four groups. We will use the data from edges.csv to draw graphs and conduct the analysis using NetworkX module. For each of the nodes in the dataset, degree centrality and eigenvector centrality will be calculated. The centrality of each group will be compared. \n",
