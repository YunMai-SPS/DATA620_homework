2017-08-11,MarketAxess Holdings Bogged Down by High Operating Expenses,"On Aug 11, we issued an updated research report on MarketAxess Holdings Inc.  MKTX  , a provider of electronic trading network for the institutional market in U.S. credit products.While MarketAxess' growth strategy has led to noticeable top and bottom-line growth, escalating costs remain a significant headwind. Total expenses increased at 11% on average from 2013-2016, thereby weighing on the company's margins and by 6.4% in the first half of 2017.We estimate the company's expenses to rise over the coming quarters given its ongoing investments in several areas including trading platform, new protocols and infrastructure as well as headcount additions. Notably, for 2017, the company anticipates total expenses in the range of $192-$208 million. The midpoint of this range reflects about 12% year-over-year increase in expenses.Over the past six months, shares of MarketAxess have returned 3% underperforming the gain of 8.5% logged by the industry  . It also fared poorly compared with returns of 22.2%, 10.4% and 7.4% for CBOE Holdings, Inc. CBOE  , Intercontinental Exchange, Inc. ICE  and Nasdaq Inc. NDAQ  , respectively. Given the headwinds faced by the company, its shares are expected to remain under pressure in the coming quarters.    During the most recently reported quarter, the company's earnings of $1.10 per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 19.5% on higher trading volumes. Also, the bottom line improved 13.6% from the year-ago quarter.Nevertheless, MarketAxess's valuation looks stretched at the current level. Looking at the company's one-forward price-to-earnings ratio, investors might not want to pay any further premium. The company currently has a one-year forward P/E ratio of 49 which is above its median range of 40. It is also higher than the one-year forward P/E ratio of 24.12 for the industry and 19.56 for the S&P 500.MarketAxess carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).

2017-07-27,Nasdaq Earnings Rise on Lower Acquisition and Restructuring Costs,"Nasdaq Inc.    (NASDAQ: NDAQ) reported record net revenue in the second quarter   of 2017, bolstered by higher equity-derivatives trading and   strength in information services. These gains, coupled with   reduced operating costs, led to a favorable quarter versus the   prior year.Data source: Nasdaq.           Image source: Getty Images.Within the company's earnings release, CEO Adena Friedman   noted that Nasdaq is benefiting from both new product   introduction on the revenue side, as well as cost synergies from   multiple recent acquisitions:""In addition to achieving a new quarterly net revenue record,   we are making significant progress against our 2017 execution   priorities, by commercializing key technologies with new products   available through the Nasdaq Financial Framework and Analytics   Hub, achieving our merger synergies ahead of our original   timeline, and raising our market share in our largest trading   categories significantly above prior year levels.""Nasdaq confirmed in its earnings report that it's already   realized the full $60 million in projected synergies from its   multiple 2016 acquisitions, after hitting   the $50 million mark last quarter.   The exchange operator doesn't offer full-fledged earnings   guidance, but management did relay that it's expecting to capture   an additional $10 million to $20 million in annual cost synergies   once all platform migrations from last year's merger transactions   are complete. With the acquisition of trading volume, software   and financial product companies, its own organic growth, and an   increasingly efficient cost structure, Nasdaq has positioned   itself nicely for continued revenue and bottom-line gains.      10 stocks we like better than Nasdaq        When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,   it can pay to listen.

2017-12-22,"Bitcoin In 2018: Can Futures, Mainstream Investors Tame The Hysteria?","Bitcoin began 2017 trading under $1,000. Then it got much   bigger. Investors big and small arrived, sometimes bailed hard -   as they did on Friday - then arrived some more. Concerns were   raised that Bitcoin barely qualified as money. Concerns were   raised that its immense transaction volumes were swallowing up   the world's energy.   Comparisons to Dutch tulip mania     piled up, and a securities regulator in December said ""   We've seen mortgages being taken out to buy   Bitcoin.    ""[ibd-display-video id=3017249 width=50 float=left   autostart=true] Which all leads to one question for 2018: Is   there any chance Bitcoin's jagged, face-melting run for the   stratosphere might become a bit tamer?The advent of Bitcoin futures from   Cboe    (   CBOE    ),   CME Group    (   CME    ) and, eventually,   Nasdaq    (   NDAQ    ), has the potential to reel Bitcoin back into orbit. A   Bitcoin ETF in 2018? Certainly not impossible. Greater   attention from regulators could help inform investors and stamp   out fraud.After a week of some moderation on spot market, volatility has   roared back in recent days. Shares of Bitcoin-related stocks   like   Riot Blockchain    (   RIOT    ),   Marathon Patent Group    (   MARA    ) and   Bitcoin Investment Trust    (GBTC) are also seeing big daily moves, while companies looking   to rebrand themselves with blockchain such as   Long Island Iced Tea    (LTEA) and   Net Element    (NETE) keep jumping in. And other cryptocurrencies, especially   Ethereum and Litecoin, have shot up in price recently.But most big banks are unlikely, for now, to gorge on the   tulips, and it's still debatable whether treating Bitcoin like a   normal investment will make it behave like one. Others wonder if   investors are prepared for the more complicated world of   investing next year that the futures will bring - to a market   where   40% of all Bitcoins are reportedly in the   possession of 1,000 holders    who could, on a whim, lop thousands of dollars off its price.""So, someone who put in $10,000 now has $2 million in his   account - does he know how to protect it when trading might go   against him?"" said Ihor Dusaniwsky, a managing director at   financial analytics firm S3 Partners.   IBD'S TAKE    :   Are Bitcoin, Ethereum and other digital currencies a   speculator's game? Individual investors should be extremely   cautious about diving into this new area. Read this feature about   Bitcoin risks and potential gains    .   Those questions were perhaps underscored on Friday, when   Bitcoin's price crumbled below $12,000, then picked up another   $1,000 later in the day,   after a week of warnings    from financial officials abroad and worries about   possible insider trading.     Bitcoin futures contracts from Cboe and CME were tracking   close to the price of Bitcoin itself.Futures contracts will allow investors to wager on whether   Bitcoin's price will rise or fall without owning the   cryptocurrency directly. If more investors, possibly anticipating   a bubble, use the futures to bet on a drop in Bitcoin, that might   help tap the brakes on cryptocurrency's feverish price increases,   the reasoning goes.That short-selling would also allow investors to hedge against   their long bets on Bitcoin and make plays in the market more   easily.""So if I bought Bitcoin at $200, and it's trading at $15,000,   I might want to hedge out some of that without actually selling   my Bitcoin,"" Dusaniwsky said. ""And this might be much easier with   futures, to get in and out of that position intraday.""The contracts would also have trading and price limits, and   could open a pathway for a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund that   would trade on the stock market - a development Dusaniwsky said   was likely in 2018. Cboe this filed with the SEC to list six   Bitcoin ETFs. The more securities available overall, the   more opportunity to short.   Intercontinental Exchange    (ICE), the company that owns the New York Stock Exchange, also   wants to offer a Bitcoin ETF.The massive retail brokerage             TD Ameritrade       (AMTD) said this month that it will let some clients trade Cboe's   Bitcoin futures, and rival   E-Trade Financial    (ETFC) followed days later. Also this month,   Interactive Brokers    (IBKR) said it would allow customers to make some bets against   those futures.Last week, there were some indications that short-sellers may   have moved in and tempered the markets. Bloomberg reported at   that time that the price of Cboe's Bitcoin futures, which cost up   to 13% more than Bitcoin itself, had over a few days drifted much   closer to the spot price of the cryptocurrency.But not everyone is convinced that Bitcoin futures will mellow   out cryptocurrency markets.""While the futures markets help bring traditional financial   institutions into the space, they do encourage speculation rather   than owning the underlying asset and are unlikely to dampen   volatility,"" Lex Sokolin, global director of fintech   strategy at Autonomous Research, said in an email, noting that a   Bitcoin ETF or mutual fund would instead be more helpful in   easing volatility.Any short-sellers would also be betting against a   cryptocurrency whose price has ballooned more than 1,300% since   the beginning of 2017. While short-selling seems likely, there   might not be as much of it as many are anticipating.""Number 1, short-sellers aren't gluttons for punishment,""   Dusaniwsky said. ""With Bitcoin going up $1,000 a day some days, I   don't see these guys jumping into the short side, just doing   outright short positions, on a whim.""Financial institutions might be fine with letting their   customers make futures trades, but the big banks are largely   staying away from doing it themselves.But   Goldman Sachs    (GS) is setting up a trading desk for cryptocurrencies and hopes   to have it running by the end of June, sources told   Bloomberg     Thursday.That would make Goldman the first of Wall Street's top trading   firms to jump into the crypto-mania. Peers like   Citigroup    (C) and   Bank of America    (BAC) are waiting to see what what happens.Bitcoin futures are too new and too small, with too little   regulatory underpinning, for the banks to get into right now,   said CFRA analyst Ken Leon before the Goldman news broke.The volatile cryptocurrency isn't exactly fodder for banks'   wealth management divisions, either. Banks, who have tried   to detox from the high-risk investments that battered them during   the financial crisis, would also have to calculate the potential   loss risk of any asset tied to Bitcoin.""I wouldn't expect to see   JPMorgan    (JPM) involved anytime soon,"" said Clyde Tinnen, a   corporate-finance partner at the law firm Withers Bergman, which   advises clients on cryptocurrency markets.But hedge funds are getting in the game. Fortress Investment   Group and Horizon Kinetics have purchased Bitcoin recently, while   executives from firms like Quantbot Technologies and Steven   Cohen's Cubist Systematic Strategies recently met to discuss how   they could profit from cryptocurrencies, according to the   Wall Street Journal    .Still, as Bitcoin's price has scorched higher, and as startup   entrepreneurs attach the ""crypto"" prefix to whatever's trending,   the Securities and Exchange Commission has started to notice. The   agency in December stopped at least two initial coin offerings -   a form of digital fundraising - that it deemed suspicious or in   violation of securities laws.The SEC has also issued advice to investors to avoid getting   conned, and even urged caution when considering celebrities'   promotions of things like ICOs - an announcement that came after   Floyd Mayweather, Jr., Paris Hilton and a few others have thrown   their support behind them.""Any celebrity or other individual who promotes a virtual   token or coin that is a security must disclose the nature, scope,   and amount of compensation received in exchange for the   promotion,"" the agency warned in November, later adding that   those celebrity endorsers ""often do not have sufficient expertise   to ensure … compliance with federal securities laws.""But as Bitcoin exchanges strain under the weight of more   interest and more serious money, disputes among developers over   how best to speed transactions through the network seem likely to   resurface in 2018.Disagreement over how to proceed has led two ""fork"" currencies   that have formed out of Bitcoin: Bitcoin Cash, in August,   and Bitcoin Gold, in October. Those cryptocurrencies use   different algorithms and equipment and have different sizes of   the blocks of code that store transaction information.As that debate goes on, or as Bitcoin's price drifts out of   reach, investors could turn their attention to lower-profile,   lower-drama currencies such as Bitcoin Cash, Ripple, Ethereum,   Litecoin and others.""Some of them could even gain advantage in the future by   offering better compliance with regulatory requirements,""   JPMorgan analysts said in a research note in December.As more people have piled into Bitcoin, the doubt from bigger   names in the financial world has built up on a daily basis. Most   recently, Fed Chair Janet Yellen said Bitcoin's presence in the   payments landscape was still very small. But she said, as others   have, that it was ""   not a stable store of value    "" and ""highly speculative."" UBS' global chief economist called   Bitcoin the ""   bubble to end all bubbles    "". Brian Armstrong, the co-counder and CEO of the cryptocurrency   exchange Coinbase, said in a December blog post: ""   Please invest responsibly.    """"Most of the investors that I talk to, they look at Bitcoin   truly as a commodity,"" Tinnen said, adding that they tend to   guard against the cryptocurrency's occasional stabs downward with   defensive investments elsewhere. ""I have to say that they are   very enthusiastic, and sometimes that enthusiasm means that they   are not always taking as clear-eyed a view as they should in   order to hedge it.""Others, Dusaniwsky said, might not be the kind of traders you   typically see on the stock market. They might not be familiar   with the investment vehicles that are coming into the market.   They might not know how to use, say, stop-loss orders, he said,   or otherwise trade their positions more professionally, if the   up-market this year heads south.""You've got a lot of sheep that are long Bitcoin,"" he said,   ""and the wolves might be starting to get into the market.""

2017-04-28,Key Takeaways From CME's Q1 Earnings,"Transaction fees account for nearly 85% of CME's revenue. Among the various asset classes, interest rate derivatives had the strongest trading volumes, and grew by 11% during the quarter, driven by the Fed's interest rate hikes in December 2016 and March 2017. The continuous shift in gold and silver prices - due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar and other economic and political factors in the U.S. - has continued to boost metals derivative volumes. However, equities and foreign exchange derivative volumes continued to decline, primarily due to a more volatile and favorable trading period last year, and partly due to investors remaining wary of these asset classes. Energy derivatives was on the negative side for the first time over the past couple of years. Without much movement in oil prices, and OPEC's stance on capping production, the asset class hasn't seen much trading activity of late. The increase in trading volumes of less expensive interest rate derivative contracts, and a decline in more expensive equity contracts, led to an overall decline in average rate per contract by over 3%. As the company continues to expand its product line and gain in trading volumes due to the recovery in U.S. macroeconomic conditions, we forecast a nearly 9% increase in transaction revenues.In Q1, the market data and information services segment saw 5% lower  revenues in comparison to Q1 2016, which the company believes is due to some large customers having consolidated their screens.  The company remains bullish on its market data and information services segment, with new products in the pipeline with enhanced business intelligence and machine learning capabilities. Since the company has already managed to gain traction by offering data services to its customers at no charges until last year, we believe these offerings across various product line is likely to be availed by customers even at a premium price, which the company expects to charge in the long term.See the full Trefis analysis for CME Group.View Interactive Institutional Research (Powered by Trefis):Global Large Cap | U.S. Mid & Small Cap | European Large & Mid Cap | More Trefis Research The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."

The bottom line also improved 31% year over year. Improved revenues, higher volumes, lower tax incidence and a solid market share aided this upside. The company witnessed revenue improvement across all its segments.Performance in Detail Nasdaq's revenues recorded $666 million, improving 15% year over year.

Nasdaq projects 2018 non-GAAP operating expense in the range of $1.295-$1.335 billion, down from the earlier guided range of $1.375-$1.415 billion.

2017-01-23,Total System (TSS) to Report Q4 Earnings: What's in Store?,"Total System Services, Inc.  TSS  is scheduled to report fourth-quarter and full-year 2016 results on Jan 24, after market close.   Notably, the company recorded a positive earnings surprise in two of the trailing four quarters.        Total System Services, Inc. Price and EPS     Surprise      Total System Services, Inc. Price and EPS   Surprise    |      Total System Services, Inc. Quote      Earnings Whispers Our quantitative model doesn't call for an earnings beat this time around. Here is why:     A stock needs to have the right combination of the two key criteria - a positive Earnings ESP  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or at least #2 (Buy) or #3 (Hold) - for increasing chances of an earnings beat. Unfortunately, this is not the case here, as elaborated below.     You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they're reported with our Earnings ESP Filter  .        Zacks ESP   : The Earnings ESP for Total System is 0.00%. This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate stand at 65 cents.        Zacks Rank   : Total System's Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) further lowers the predictive power of ESP. We caution investors against Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement.     What to Expect?      Total System's quarterly result should continue to benefit from its long-term processing contracts as it remains focused on retaining and acquiring clients.     Results should reflect continued revenue and transaction growth with increased accounts on file from the company's international business. Also, North America segment should see higher revenues from the cross-sell of products and services.     During the third-quarter earnings conference, management noted that deleveraging of  balance sheet is ahead of the projected period, with $175 million of debt pay-down during the third quarter, taking the two-quarter total of deleveraging to $300 million. Management stated that it plans to reduce leverage by $800 million over eight quarters. Hence, fourth-quarter 2016 should be no different.     Total System adjusted its financial guidance for full-year 2016. The company reiterated its adjusted EPS attributable to the company's common shareholders from continuing operations in the range of $2.78-$2.85. However, the company no longer expects the low end of the range as previously guided.     In order to account for currency impact, the company reduced its net revenue guidance for the current year to $3.03-$3.05 billion (21-22% growth) from the previous range of $3.04-$3.10 billion (22-24%).     Revenue growth for North America business continues to be at or slightly above 5% for the year.     Free cash flow is expected in the range of $550-$570 million for the year, higher than the previous outlook of $510 million to $540 million range.     Total System's activities during the quarter were inadequate to win analysts' confidence. As a result, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter remained stable at 65 cents over the last seven days. The estimate, however reflect a year-over-year increase of 23%.     Stocks That Warrant a Look      Here are some stocks worth considering, as they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.     Nasdaq, Inc.

2017-04-25,What To Watch For In NASDAQ's Q1 Earnings,"Non-trading businesses including information, technology and listing services, which account for nearly 60% of the overall revenue, are likely to drive growth with increased demand for data and technology-related products and services. In-house products such as IR Insights and Influencer have attracted a lot of customers since launch in 2016 and we expect increased adoption in the near term as well.A concern is the significant drop in cash equity trading volumes. Much of this can be attributed to a tough year-on-year comparison due to the volatility seen in the global economy at the beginning of 2016, which was driven by uncertainty around oil prices , a slowdown in China and slow GDP growth in the U.S. at the time. However, declining market share due to tough competition from new exchanges such as IEX, and the fact that the company's offerings remain limited to equity products, could weigh on its results. The prior year saw over 100 basis points decline in the cash equity market share.Please refer to the full Trefis analysis for NasdaqView Interactive Institutional Research (Powered by Trefis):Global Large Cap | U.S. Mid & Small Cap | European Large & Mid Cap The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."

2017-06-26,The 3 Best Trades Right Now? The Whole Stock Market!,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsMy weekend survey of equities revealed one big theme - the whole stock market is a buy!And no, we're not talking about scooping up the S&P 500 or the Dow Jones Industrial Average . We're not even talking about going for small-caps via the Russell 2000 . This week's best trades will allow us to buy up the stock market via exchange stocks. You know, the companies that own the marketplaces where traders gather to transact.Though the charts of all three vary slightly, they are all boasting low-risk setups. Their current pattern goes by many names: bull retracement, bull pullback, swing buy. On their way to the moon, all three decided to pause for a bit last week. Sellers were allowed to exit with profits in tow while the prices of all three stocks retreated to potential support levels.And now, it's time for buyers to strike. A tight stop will keep the risk small, and if the uptrends persist, the rewards could be significant.Enough with the preamble. Let's hop to it. Here are three of the best trades to buy the whole stock market.CME Group Inc (NASDAQ: CME ) operates the world's largest options and futures exchange. And it's flashing an attractive pullback for any and all would-be buyers.Earlier in the month, CME staged a serious breakout with robust follow-through. The surge carried shares to a marginal new 52-week high before resistance entered the scene and smacked the stock lower. CME's retreat has taken shares close to the rising 20-day moving average which is as good a spot as any to look for support to form.Volume patterns have also been supporting the bulls' campaign. A score of accumulation days accompanied the breakout suggesting institutions were piling in. This increases the chances the current dip gets bought.The Trade: Wait for CME to rise above a prior day's high to confirm that support is forming. Then buy the stock. Consider placing a stop loss below $122.As its namesake suggests, CBOE Holdings, Inc (NASDAQ: CBOE ) owns the Chicago Board Options Exchange. It also acquired BATS Global Markets less than a year ago.CBOE stock currently boasts one of the most consistent looking uptrends on the Street. Year-to-date the stock is up 21% scoring some serious outperformance in the process. Last week's mild bout of profit taking dropped the stock to its rising 20-day moving average.The Trade: The stock market is falling in Monday's early trading, so consider for a break above Monday's high ($89.34) before buying shares. The $88 is short-term support, so a stop loss below that for a quick trade makes sense. Otherwise, use the 50-day moving average near $85.70 if you're looking to ride the trend.Nasdaq Inc (NASDAQ: NDAQ ) shares round out today's trio. The financial services corporation owns the Nasdaq exchange as well as eight European stock exchanges.From a price action perspective, NDAQ is probably the sloppiest of today's selections. But things have improved over the past month, and that's why it's making today's appearance.With the early-June surge, NDAQ was able to vault back above all its moving averages. The 20-day and 50-day are now both rising in bullish fashion. Last week's pullback found support right at the 20-day, and the stock is attempting to rally in early morning trading today.The Trade: Consider buying shares near $70. If you're looking to bail at the first sign of trouble, use a break of $69.40 as your stop loss. Otherwise, use $68.75.As of this writing, Tyler Craig did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.The post The 3 Best Trades Right Now?

2018-05-16,7 Reasons Why You Should Retain Nasdaq in Your Portfolio,"Estimates for Nasdaq, Inc  . NDAQ  have been revised upward over the past 30 days, reflecting analysts' confidence in the stock. The stock has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 and 2019 earnings being raised 1.4% and 0.9% to $4.90 and $5.35, respectively.        Let's focus on the factors that make Nasdaq a stock to hold on to for greater returns.     Growth Initiatives  : Nasdaq intensified its focus on Market Technology and Information Services businesses, offering biggest growth opportunities. It also lays an emphasis on its core special marketplace platform businesses. Additionally, the company intends to lower its capital resources for investment in business, failing to offer considerable growth for Nasdaq.     Nasdaq's growth has also been driven by its initiatives to accelerate non-transaction revenue base including market technology, listing and information revenues. Management estimates medium-term outlook of 8%-11% growth.     Compelling Inorganic Growth Story  : Nasdaq has accelerated its growth profile via prudent acquisitions that helped it expand its technology offering, gain a direct access to the Canadian equities market and fortify its Corporate Solutions business. Buyouts continue to enhance the company's capabilities and have already been accretive to its operational results.     Improving Top Line  : Driven by both organic and inorganic strategic initiatives, Nasdaq has been witnessing its top line growing over the last several quarters. We hope this trend will continue, given the company's endeavor to pursue initiatives to ramp up its growth profile.     Effective Capital Management  : Nasdaq boasts a healthy balance sheet and a solid cash position along with modest operating cash flow from its diverse business model. This in turn aided the company to raise dividends at a four-year CAGR of 35.6%. The company has a $627-million share buyback authorization. Its dividend yield betters the industry average, making the stock an attractive pick for yield-seeking investors.     Growth Projections  : The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings per share is pegged at $4.90, representing a year-over-year increase of 20.7% on 5.1% higher revenues of $2.6 billion.     For 2019, the consensus mark for earnings per share is pegged at $5.35 on $2.7 billion revenues, thus depicting a respective 9.2% and 3.6% year-over-year rise.     Nasdaq has an expected long-term earnings per share growth rate of 9.7%.     Positive Earnings Surprise History  : The company flaunts an encouraging earnings surprise history, having exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing six quarters with an average beat of 4.2%. This trend of consecutive estimate beats underscores the company's operational excellence.     Underpriced  : The shares are trading lower than the industry average. Considering the company's price-to-book ratio, the trailing 12-month P/B ratio of 2.6 falls below the industry average of 2.8.     Stocks to Consider      Some better-ranked stocks from the finance sector are CME Group CME  , Markel Corporation MKL  and RLI Corp. RLI  .     CME Group operates contract markets for the trading of futures and options on futures contracts worldwide. It pulled off an average four-quarter positive surprise of 1.86%. It carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see    the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy)   stocks here   .     Markel markets and underwrites specialty insurance products in the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada and internationally. The company came up with positive surprises in the last four quarters, the average beat being 15.54%. The stock sports a Zacks Rank #1.     RLI Corp. underwrites property and casualty insurance in the United States and internationally. The company delivered an average positive surprise of 33.65% and has a Zacks Rank of 1.     Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest Strategies      It's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +21.9% in 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +115.0%, +109.3%, +104.9%, +98.6%, and +67.1%.     And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon. Over the years it has been remarkably consistent. From 2000 - 2017, the composite yearly average gain for these strategies has beaten the market more than 19X over. Maybe even more remarkable is the fact that we're willing to share their latest stocks with you without cost or obligation.

2016-11-01,Intercontinental Exchange Inc's Earnings Notch Another Double-Digit Gain,"Image source: Getty Images.   Intercontinental Exchange    (NYSE: ICE) continued its streak of double-digit earnings growth   during the third quarter. Driven by the recent acquisitions of   Interactive Data and Trayport, ICE was able to capture   stronger-than-expected expense synergies to bolster its bottom   line. That helped the company more than offset weaker trading   revenue as a result of muted volatility during the quarter.             Metric                        Q3 2016 Actuals                        Q3 2015 Actuals                        Growth (YOY)           Revenues, less transaction-based expenses$1.1 billion$816 million32.1%Adjusted net income$385 million$323 million19.2%Adjusted EPS$3.21$2.9110.3%Data source: Intercontinental Exchange.Acquisitions drove growth this quarter:CEO Jeffrey Sprecher commented on the company's results,   saying:In 2016, we've grown revenue, margins and earnings while     investing in our long term growth. Our double digit earnings     growth year to date is driven by serving the rising demand for     risk management, data and for capital efficient solutions in     the US, Europe and Asia as markets evolve, driven by     regulation, automation and innovation.The additions of Interactive Data and Trayport are driving   results at the moment, evident by the strong growth in data   services revenue. These deals allowed the company to overcome a   weaker trading market during the quarter. Those market conditions   also impacted rival   Nasdaq    (NASDAQ: NDAQ) , which saw a ""contraction in trading revenues   when compared to an especially volatile trading environment in   the prior-year period."" However, Nasdaq was likewise able to   offset that impact via acquisitions. In fact, during the third   quarter, Nasdaq's recent acquisitions added $58 million to its   top line, which is noteworthy given that year-over-year revenue   growth was just $56 million.ICE continues to do two things to drive growth. First, it   makes strategic acquisitions to bolster is product offerings. In   fact, it completed another deal after the quarter ended,   acquiring   S&P Global    's(NYSE: SPGI) Standard & Poor's Security Evaluations and   Credit Market Analysis businesses. Second, it pushes expenses out   of those newly acquired businesses to drive earnings and cash   flow growth. It has been doing an even better job at that this   year, evidenced by the acceleration of its expected cost   synergies. Given its string of recent deals and ample liquidity,   the company's growth-by-acquisition strategy is showing no signs   of slowing down.

2018-01-20,Could These High-Flying Tech Stocks Start Paying a Dividend?,"Many investors, young and old, love their dividends. And in   the age of low-interest rates, many older investors are no doubt   turning to    dividend   stocks    for both income and growth.One area in which these investors may have a difficult time   investing is the tech space. In the tech industry companies   can be reluctant to commit to a dividend payment because the   industry often requires having the capital available to adapt to   the latest technological advancement or trends quickly, while   also facing a constant threat of disruption. Steve Jobs had a   no-dividend-ever policy while he was running   Apple    (NASDAQ: AAPL) , but after Apple's cash ballooned to over $100   billion after his death, the company began paying a dividend in   2012.Unfortunately for yield-only investors, much of the broader   market gains over the last few years have come from these   cash-hoarding tech companies. Over the last three years, the   NASDAQ    has shot up 73%, compared with the   S&P    's 38%. In addition, the prospect of reduced repatriation   taxes in the new tax bill means these companies may have more   options for their cash than they know what to do with. In that   case, here are some A-list tech stocks that could follow   Apple's lead and start paying a dividend in the next few   years.           Love growth today and income later? Consider these three     tech names. Image source: Getty Images.   Alphabet    Inc.'s Google (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) absolutely dominates   the online search industry, leading to a whopping 42.4% market   share of the U.S. digital advertising market, according to   eMarketer. Moreover, the digital advertising industry is growing   16% per year, so there is still room for this leader to grow. In   addition to search, Google continues to roll out more video   offerings like YouTube Red and skinny over-the-top bundle YouTube   TV, along with a push into more   premium video content    . Google's dominance of the digital advertising space has fueled   a massive growth in earnings from roughly $11 billion five years   ago to $21 billion today.Of course, Alphabet also has its ""Other Bets"" segment, where   it aims to use its artificial intelligence chops to incubate new   business lines. Several of these bets, especially Google Cloud   and self-driving car unit Waymo, may become cash generators   sooner than you might think    .Add all of that to an enormous $100 billion cash position, and   there you have a recipe for some sort of capital return program   for shareholders. While buybacks may make sense for Alphabet, its   P/E ratio is still rather high at 37 times earnings, which may   make   share repurchases    less attractive, so a cash return could very well take the form   of dividends in the years ahead.The aforementioned digital advertising space is becoming more   and more of a duopoly (at least outside of China), with Google's   ""Coke,"" competing with   Facebook    's (NASDAQ: FB) ""Pepsi."" With its core Facebook, Instagram, and   WhatsApp brands, Facebook has a huge 21% market share in U.S.   digital advertising and is forecast to grow that share in the   years ahead.Facebook has posted astounding earnings growth, from only   about $1 billion at the time of its IPO to more than $15 billion   over the past year. The company has one of the very best returns   per employee, leading to robust operating margins of almost 50%   and a $38 billion-plus cash hoard.Facebook doesn't have as many capital-intensive ""Other Bets""   as Alphabet does, and, given a similarly high   P/E ratio    of 37, it's not crazy to envision a Facebook dividend coming down   the pike.One of the best-performing stocks over the past few years has   been   Adobe    (NASDAQ: ADBE) . Its transition to a cloud-based,   software-as-a-service model and prime execution has made its   Creative Cloud Suite a must-have for visual artists of all types.   Since the company exited that cloud transition in 2014, its   earnings per share have more than   quadrupled    .That stunning turn of events has also resulted in a strong $4   billion net cash position and a sky-high P/E ratio of 55. In that   light, it's always possible Adobe could start devoting some of   its shareholder return program -- which currently comprises   repurchases -- toward dividends.So for income-oriented investors looking to add some growth   and tech names to their portfolios, Alphabet, Facebook, and Adobe   -- each of which   could    begin paying dividends in the years ahead -- may fit the   bill.          10 stocks we like better than Alphabet (A     shares)            When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run     for over a decade,     Motley Fool Stock Advisor      , has tripled the market.*David and Tom just revealed what they believe are the            10 best stocks           for investors to buy right now… and Alphabet (A shares) wasn't     one of them!

2017-12-18,A Look Back At NASDAQ's Performance In 2017,"We have a $92 price estimate for NASDAQ's stock  , which is significantly ahead of the current market price.   Focus On Non-Trading Segments Has Been Paying   Off NASDAQ generates about 65% of its revenues from Information, Technology and Listing services. These businesses have grown by 6% overall year-to-date, and around 5% annually over the past three years. The company launched several new products in the past few years, including IR Insight, which incorporates news, recommendations, and trackers on a single platform.  A second noteworthy product is Nasdaq Influencers, wherein marketing professionals from different companies can connect with industry peers to promote their brands and share insights and recommendations. This contributed to the Information Services segment's strong performance. Meanwhile, the Market Technology segment grew organically due to increased uptake of software licensing and support, surveillance, and advisory offerings. Increased demand for data and technology-related products and services is likely to continue in the near term, and should help sustain the growth momentum for these segments.          Market Services Has Shown Improvement Under The Influence   of Acquisitions The company generates about 35% of its revenue from Market Services, and this segment has grown by 9% year to date. Trade Management services grew due to an increase in customer demand for third-party connectivity, co-location, and test facilities. Equity options volumes picked up in pace following the acquisition of ISE, which gave NASDAQ a 42% market share in the U.S. equity options market. The overall growth was relatively lower because of the decline in cash equity trading volumes, resulting from unfavorable economic conditions and increased competition.

2017-01-27,Why MasterCard (MA) May Beat on Earnings in Q4?,"We expect MasterCard Inc.  MA  to beat earnings expectations when it reports its fourth-quarter and full-year 2016 results, on Jan 31.   For instance, it is building the long-term debit-deal announced in 2015 in Italy with Poste Italian, and has also been expanding partnership by converting a major portion of their prepaid portfolio. Also, the company should benefit from the numerous new deals with a number of banks in China, inked in third-quarter 2016.     Additionally, quarterly results are likely to get support from MasterCard's digital strategy.     However, on the downside, the U.S. credit purchase volume growth will remain slow, reflecting the continued impact of the USAA portfolio roll-off.     Also, higher rebates and incentives are likely to affect profitability to some extent, as the company usually signs several new agreements and renews agreements in the fourth quarter. Moreover, higher operating expenses, primarily due to continued investments to support strategic initiatives, may keep the bottom line under pressure.     For 2016, management had guided for a low double digit net revenue growth on a currency nuetral basis. Total operating expense is expecetd to increase in the low double-digit range, excluding special items. On a currency neutral basis, expense is expected to exhibit low double-digit increase.Notably, MasterCard has a decent surprise history.

We generated total net revenue of   $607 million and non-GAAP operating income of $290 million, up 4%   and 8% respectively, year-over-year.We continue to execute well to achieve our 2017 priorities   including improving our competitive position across our   businesses, integrating the 2016 acquisitions and delivering on   their full promise and commercializing our expertise in emerging   technologies, and bringing new solutions to the marketplace.Growth was especially strong in the recurring and subscription   side of the business where we generated 76% of our third-quarter   revenue. First, Information Services saw strong performance with   $150 million revenue for the quarter with especially strong   growth in index licensing and services revenue up 21%   year-over-year, a testament to the unique positioning that we've   established in the index base with over 40% of our licensed AUM   and smart-beta products.Market technology generated revenues of $77 million, an   increase of 5% year-over-year, and year-to-date the segment has   generated $215 million in revenue, up 8% year-over-year. We   exited Q3 on a strong footing in terms of backlog, new client   wins, and fast business trends, all of which we expect to drive   future growth. We're positioning ourselves to further that growth   momentum through our investment in Sybenetix and internal   development initiatives, most notably, our investment in the   Nasdaq Financial Framework, our next-generation infrastructure   platform.Under our market services segment, Trade Management Services   saw strong growth from some of our newer products, in particular   third-party connectivity which contributed to a 9% increase in   the quarter, year-over-year. The trading side of the business is   performing well despite historic lows and volatility and muted   industry volumes due to market share gains in the three largest   trading revenue categories, U.S. Options, U.S. Equities, and   Nordic Equities. This is a visible example of the progress   against one of our 2017 execution priorities to improve our   competitive position. With another one of our 2017 priorities,   our acquisition integration efforts, I'm very pleased to say that   we have completed the technology integration of the IC Options   Exchanges onto the Inet Technology. The team did an outstanding   job with the complex integration which they completed on time and   which enabled us to execute on all our synergy expectations.There are areas of our business that continue to show slower   growth than we would like, in particular, our Corporate Solutions   and our Listing Services businesses. In terms of listings, we are   seeing some encouraging business level operating trends. In the   Nordics, despite a seasonally slow third-quarter, our new   listings are still on their way to a record in 2017 with 72 new   listings so far, this year, or 24% year-to-date. In the U.S. we   have had 87 IPOs during the first nine months of 2017, up 32%   year-to-date over the comparable period last year. We have   increased our IPO win-rate to 77% during the third-quarter,   improving our year-to-date win-rate to 60%.In 2018, we'll enter the final phase of the 2015 pricing   changes in listings when U.S. corporate listing customers who   haven't already opted in will transition to the bundled annual,   and listing of additional share fees, which will bring a moderate   revenue benefit next year.In Corporate Solutions, where year-over-year comparisons were   flat, we're taking action to better position ourselves   strategically and leverage the parts of those businesses that   play to Nasdaq's strengths and expertise going forward. I'll   provide more detail around this later in my remarks.Moving on from the financial metrics, I wanna spend a few   minutes discussing the long-term opportunities we're focused on   that will continue to position this firm for growth in the   quarters and years to come. As I mentioned in our September call,   in terms of our strategic planning, we've been examining the key   trends that will drive change and evolution in our industry, with   a focus on how we can best serve our clients as they adapt and   respond to technology and other industry advancements in the   coming years. We intend to use our capital, talents, and other   resources to align ourselves with the need of our clients both   today and tomorrow.The specific long-term trends that we believe will impact our   business are first, the emergence of a marketplace economy with   two-sided market mechanisms proliferating far beyond financial   markets. Over the year, using our market infrastructure   technology, we have worked with third-party clients looking to   create auction mechanisms or continuous markets to allow for   price discovery for assets outside the scope of the financial   markets today. We believe that this trend to give consumers the   power to negotiate price for goods that are easily transferred,   coupled with advanced digital payment options, will continue to   expand.Essentially, the Nasdaq financial framework offers our   existing clients, but also the emerging marketplace economy, a   modern architecture that embraces the latest advancements in   technology. Second is the role of the investment banks as   critical pillars of the financial system. Our view is that many   of the global banks have emerged from the aftermath of the credit   crisis in a position of strength. As they reorient their own   capital allocation priorities, they have developed a different   attitude toward technology partnership. Where they're willing to   find strategic partners, who have specialized capabilities in   areas where they don't view the technology as a key competitive   differentiator, and that can be delivered in a less expensive way   than their own internal IT organizations can manage. They can   then focus their internal IT efforts on those areas that provide   them specific competitive advantages.An example of that shift has been our Ocean initiative, where   we seek to serve as the technology partner for banks in managing   their internal trading venues. In the third-quarter, we have won   a second Ocean mandate, in this case to power a tier one global   bank's foreign exchange trading platform. We continue to have   active and encouraging discussions with other banks seeking to   find ways to optimize their internal operations with our market   infrastructure technology.The third major trend that every industry is facing is the   explosion of data coupled with the advancement of machine   intelligence. We have built a successful data franchise of global   distribution and today we have new tools to dissect our data,   intersect it with output information and deliver deeper and more   meaningful insights to our clients. Our analytics hub is a good   example. We're using machine intelligence to provide investors   with robust signals that can help them navigate the financial   markets and execute their investment and trading strategies more   efficiently. Similarly, for our corporate clients, we've just   launched IR360 which mines data in a new way to deliver insights   to IR officers and other executives on their investor base and   how they're interacting with them. In our Smart Surveillance   business, we're creating evermore intelligent alerts and other   capabilities that enable more sophisticated means to oversee the   activities across markets globally.The last major trend is the shifting environment and   investment management. We're seeing shifts that go far beyond the   active to passive dynamic. For example, the increasing importance   of investing in private companies, the growth and quantitative   strategies, and overall the increased competition that all asset   managers are facing despite a rising tide of evermore investable   assets entering the markets in the coming years. We believe that   this trend coupled with the third trend of the data explosion   creates interesting opportunities to serve the asset management   industry with increasingly sophisticated data and analytics with   the aim to empower them to compete more effectively in a shifting   environment.We are excited that we have just closed on our acquisition of   eVestment. The special fit between eVestment and Nasdaq creates   opportunities to build our role as a key differentiated analytics   partner in the investment community. Our interactions with the   eVestment team in the weeks since announcing the acquisition,   through to closing this week, has only raised our conviction on   this fantastic opportunity. These initiatives and others that we   have in our information services segment pipeline will enable us   to continue our sharp focus on delivering more viable information   and intelligence to our client.As we completed our strategic review, we assessed our current   assets and capabilities and mapped them against our areas of   strategic focus. In that process, we identified where we have   assets that are ready to be applied against our focus areas,   where we need to invest to improve our position, and where we may   have assets that are not core to our future. Due to that   evaluation, we have placed our Public Relations Solutions, and   Digital Media Services business under strategic review.As you mentioned in our release, when we have material news   related to this business is to share with you, we will do so. By   retaining and focusing on our IR intelligence solutions and board   and leadership portal, we will be able to continue to serve as a   key partner to our corporate clients as they navigate the global   capital markets. We will maintain the capabilities that are   strategic to them in their governance and IR relationships.The strategic pivot we've just begun to implement has us   better oriented today to pursue our objectives. But we're also   working to institutionalize some of the process and learning that   occurred during this long-term strategic analysis. By regularly   reviewing, assessing and making adjustments when needed to   maximize our long-term effectiveness and making this as much a   part of the culture as our operating and efficiency disciplines   will put us in a great position to ensure how we can deliver for   our clients and our shareholders alike.Lastly, I want to spend a few minutes on the regulatory   environment. Nasdaq's mission is to use ingenuity, integrity, and   insights to deliver markets that promote economic growth. As part   of that mission, we want to ensure that the U.S. capital markets   are the best, and most robust that they can be. To that end, in   May we released a blueprint for revitalizing the U.S. capital   markets with recommendations that we see as essential where the   U.S. retains its preeminence in the global capital markets. As   part of our initiative, we're seeking to gain key support from   key stakeholders to increase the appeal a public market for   innovative and growing companies.We've been encouraged by several actions taken by the new   administration in recent months. Specifically, soon after   Chairman Clayton was sworn in, he extended the ability to submit   confidential filings to all companies, not just those with less   than $1 billion in annual revenue. We also applaud Congress for   introducing several pieces of legislation in the last several   weeks focused on the public equity markets, including a bill to   strengthen proxy advisory firm oversight and all of which aim to   create more appealing public company experience while preserving   critical investor protections.On October 6th, the U.S. Treasury published its report   recommending various reforms to how the capital markets can   support economic growth with considerable focus on the U.S.   equity markets. There are areas in the report where the U.S.   Treasury is in complete alignment with the recommendations in   Nasdaq's blueprint including reducing corporate disclosure   obligations that are principally politically motivated. Working   to establish more meaningful proxy access thresholds, reviewing   oversight of proxy advisory firms, and reforming shareholder   litigation. Also in alignment with Nasdaq's recommendation was   Treasury's desire to give less liquid issuers more choice on the   market structure of their listing exchange. Notably, they support   revisions to unlisted trading privileges to allow a single   exchange to trade a company's stock in order to reconsolidate the   company's liquidity with the aim to improve market quality and   lower their equity cost to capital.There are also other market structure recommendations such as   increased ATS and payment   [inaudible] [00:14:03]    disclosures which have had and continue to have Nasdaq support.   In other areas such as the Treasury's recommendations around the   Sip Data Role and Satisfying Best Execution Requirements and   their view on SEC review standards for market-data fee filings,   we view Treasury's recommendations and priorities as completely   consistent with current law and precedent. Treasury also   recommends the SEC consider a potential for a multiple   consolidator system for the provision of Sip Fees. Nasdaq has not   opposed such a system as long as it can be demonstrated that it   will not impose new burdens on broker-dealers or the exchanges to   create such a system and that a reasonable articulation   supporting the economic benefits to investors is made before   embarking the creation of a multiple consolidator role.In Michaels' remarks, he'll discuss some incremental   disclosures we made this quarter to bring more transparency to   the special focused for investors. I would like to summarize my   comments by saying that we are very pleased with our continued   solid performance across our business which has been propelled by   our focus and achievement against our 2017 execution priorities.   We're excited about the strategic direction that we're embarking   on which should enable us to focus on the evolving future needs   of our clients. We are pleased to see our U.S. regulatory agenda   playing out with initial regulatory and political actions aimed   to create a better and more inviting public environment for   innovative companies. With that, I'll turn it over to Michael to   review the financial details.   Michael Ptasznik    --   Chief Financial Officer, EVP Corporate Strategy   Thank you, Adena. Good morning everyone.My comments will primarily focus on our non-GAAP results and   all comparisons will be to the prior year period unless otherwise   noted. Reconciliations of U.S. GAAP to non-GAAP results can be   found in the attachments to our press release and in the   presentation that's available on our website at   ir.nasdaq.com.Starting with the third quarter revenue performance as shown   on page three of the presentation, and organic growth on pages   four and sixteen, the 4%, or $22 million increase in record net   revenue of $607 million consisted organic growth of $50 million   with 3% organic growth in the non-trading segments, and 1%   organic growth in market services. A $7 million favorable impact   from changes in foreign exchange rates.We'll look now at the highlights within each of the reporting   segments. I will start with Information Services which as   reflected on pages five and sixteen, saw a $13 million or 9%   increase in revenue consisting of $12 million or 9% organic   growth. Index Licensing and Services revenues were up 21% in the   third-quarter of 2017, primarily due to higher assets under   management and exchange-traded products linked to Nasdaq indexes,   with AUM reaching a record $154 billion as of September 30th,   2017. Market Technology revenue, as shown on pages six and   sixteen, increased $4 million or 5% with organic growth totaling   $2 million or 3%. Organic growth totaled 8% on a year-to-date   basis which we point out because organic growth and market   technology tends to fluctuate quarter-to-quarter more than other   segments.The period in backlog finished at 805 million, a record high   and an increase of 9% from the prior-year quarter. The operating   income margin for Market Technology was 21%, down five percentage   points from 26% in the prior year period. Reflecting the impact   of investments, we are making to upgrade our technology for the   next generation of Nasdaq financial framework and to enhance and   grow our surveillance offering.Turning to corporate services on pages seven and sixteen,   revenues declined $1 million, or 1% while listings activity in   the Nordic region is robust, revenue growth in the Nordics was   offset by lower U.S. listings revenue from the runoff of listing   of additional shares or LAS fees due to activity generated in   past years. For the Corporate Solutions segment, growth was flat   in the quarter. Reflecting the progress, we've achieved in our   synergy targets, the corporate services operating margin was 28%   versus 26% in the prior year period.Market Services net revenue on pages eight and sixteen saw a   $6 million, or 3% increase equally split between organic growth   and the positive impact from changes in foreign exchange. Market   Services operating income margin totaled 54%, unchanged versus   the prior year period.Turning to pages nine and sixteen to review expenses. Non-GAAP   operating expenses were unchanged at $317 million, with a $4   million organic expense decrease offset by $4 million unfavorable   impact from the changes in foreign exchange rates. Turning to   slide ten a revised 2017 non-GAAP operating expense guidance is   1.275 billion, to 1.29 billion versus 1.26 billion to 1.29   billion previously. The updated guidance largely reflects the   closing of our acquisition of eVestment earlier this week, and   Sybenetix toward the end of the third quarter.As is our typical practice, we'll establish 2018 expense   guidance when we report the 4Q 17 results in late January, but   understanding that many of you will be working now to incorporate   our acquisitions, particularly eVestment into your model, please   keep the following in mind: considering our 2018 expense run   rate, in addition to the organic growth rate of core expenses   which in recent full year periods has been 3%, we believe our   2018 expense run rate should also reflect a 6% non-organic   increase over 2017 due to the full year impact of the late 2017   acquisitions of eVestments and Sybenetix. The 6% non-organic   increase reflects growth in the expense bases of the acquisitions   to support the continued organic growth, as well as upfront   integration costs including certain retention and sensitive   programs.Non-GAAP operating income increased 8% in the third quarter of   2017 and the non-GAAP operating margin totaled 48%, an increase   from 46% in the prior year period. Interest expense was 32   million in the third quarter of 2017, a decrease of 4 million   versus the prior year period primarily due to a lower average   debt balance since the 2016 acquisitions. The non-GAAP effective   tax rate for the third-quarter of 2017 was 31% in the middle of   the 30 to 32% range we provided during the last quarterly call.   We continue to expect the 2017 non-GAAP effective tax rate to be   in the range of 30 to 32%. Non-GAAP net income attributable to   Nasdaq for the third-quarter of 2017 was 181 million, or $1.06   per diluted share compared to 154 million or $0.91 per diluted   share in the prior year period. The adoption of accounting   standard ASU2016-09 added $0.04 to our 3Q 17 results.Turning to capital, as shown on Slide 11, debt increased 191   million versus 2Q 17 primarily due to issuing a $500 million   floating rate note during the period in preparation for the   closing of the eVestment transaction and a $48 million increase   in Eurobonds due to changes in FX rates. This increase is   partially offset as we used a portion of the proceeds to   temporarily pay down $340 million of commercial paper. This   resulted in our debt to EBITDA ratio ending the period at 3.1   times versus 3.0 times at the end of the second-quarter of 2017.   With the eVestment acquisition, we expect our leverage ratio to   temporarily increase and then we plan to deleverage a mid-two   times leverage ratio by mid-2019. Share repurchases in the third   quarter totaled $18 million, bringing year-to-date repurchases to   175 million. Together with dividend payments, we have returned   $355 million to shareholders through the nine months of 2017   representing 66% of our non-GAAP net income in the period.Looking forward, while the near-term our actions, in part,   will reflect our commitment to deleverage toward our mid-2019   commitment to reach a mid-2s gross debt to EBITDA ratio, we are   looking to optimize a return to shareholders through continued   investment in organic growth initiatives, carefully considered   M&A, continuing to grow the dividend as earnings and cash   flow increase and buy-backs are principally offset the impact of   share issuance.Before I turn the call back over to Adena, we wanted to take   this opportunity to provide you with some additional color on our   information services business and have added some additional   disclosure on slides twelve and thirteen. First, I'd like to   provide some detail on the implications of the eVestment   acquisition we closed this week and how its revenues will be   reflected in our financials in light of the temporary impacts of   the purchase accounting adjustment for deferred revenue   balances.On page twelve of the quarterly presentation, we reiterate   that eVestment revenues have grown an average of 12% per year   over the period from 2013 through the first the first-half of   2017. 2Q 17 trailing 12-month revenues were $81 million due to a   writedown of deferred revenue under purchase accounting, revenues   related to eVestment are expected to be reduced by approximately   $34 million for the 12-month period following the acquisition; or   9 million in 4Q 17, 11 million in 1Q 18, 8 million in 2Q, 5   million in Q3, and 1 million in 4Q 18. Revenues in 2019 and   beyond will not be affected by the purchase accounting adjustment   to deferred revenues.Secondly, I'd like to follow-up Adena's comments on the   regulatory environment and in order to help answer a request from   the investment community for detail on the data business, we have   included a slide on page thirteen of the earnings deck. We hope   this helps investors understand some of the nuance in our global   information services business, in particular understanding the   portion of our business that comes from the U.S. Equity and   Proprietary Depth and Shared Tape Data Product Groups. This   revenue consists of a number of different products that are   grouped into the categories of pro-display and non-display fees,   non-pro fees, license fees, as well as the revenues from Tapes A,   B, and C.Interestingly, as we have continued to diversify and expand   our overall global information services business with particular   focus on our index business and non-equities data over the past   12-months our U.S. Equities Depth Fees represent approximately 4%   of our overall revenue. As the chart demonstrates, today, most of   our information services revenues, and particularly our growth   opportunities are focused on products and services that are not   related to U.S. Equity Market Structure. This will be further   diversified and enhanced with the inclusion of eVestment starting   this quarter....Thank you for your time and I would now like to turn it back   to the operator for Q&A     Operator   Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen if you wish to ask a question   at this time, please press star then one on your touchtone   telephone. If your question has been answered or you wish to   remove yourself from the queue, please press the pound key. We   ask that you please limit yourself to one question and one   related follow-up.Our first question comes from Rich Repetto with Sandler   O'Neill. You may begin.   Rich Repetto    --   Sandler O'Neill & Partners -- Analyst   Good morning, Adena. Good morning, Michael.   Michael Ptasznik    --   Chief Financial Officer, EVP Corporate Strategy   Good morning.   Adena T. Friedman    --   President, Chief Executive Officer, COO, and Director   Good morning.   Rich Repetto    --   Sandler O'Neill & Partners -- Analyst   I guess the question is gonna be, since you just went through   slide thirteen, Michael, but on the market data, I think it was a   combination of Treasury report as well as a new appointment at   the SEC. Could you comment, Adena, on any views you might have.   Obviously, the positions of the individual that's appointed the   head of trading and markets were very much, I would say, are pro   dealer. Could you comment on what you'd expect? Because I think   the investment community is adding these two together, I guess?   And what [do] you expect from a person taking that position?   Adena T. Friedman    --   President, Chief Executive Officer, COO, and Director   I would say very definitively we've had a long and productive   working relationship with the SEC, and we expect to continue to.   I think that since Chairman Clayton came into the role earlier   this year, we feel that we have lined up some key areas of   concern that we've had around the capital markets, and making   sure that we have a great balance of investor protection with a   robust and exciting U.S. public capital markets, and we would   expect that we will continue to be able to work toward those   goals with the chairman as well as with the staff and we look   forward to working with Brett and his new role on Trading and   Markets. I think in general, as you mentioned with the Treasury   report as well as with the changes there, we feel that the   Treasury report is pretty clear in articulating issues around   market data that are still very consistent with the SEC and their   guidance around the use of Sip Data for best set as well as the   reasonable and fair standard that they apply to our market data   filings today. We don't really see any change that comes from the   Treasury report recommendations or from the activities that we'll   have at the SEC in that regard.   Rich Repetto    --   Sandler O'Neill & Partners -- Analyst   Thanks, that's helpful Adena.The last question is more open, but you did outline when you   look in the key areas of growth for strategic planning, whether   it be the marketplace economy, investment bank, etc., I guess the   question is have you been able, as you assess the whole strategic   pivot, does this incrementally add to the growth rate? What do   you expect, if you could quantify that in any way it'd be   helpful?   Adena T. Friedman    --   President, Chief Executive Officer, COO, and Director   Sure. I think that we have been, and will continue to be very   focused on total shareholder return. We have as our goals to   deliver double-digit total shareholder return and we will   continue to have that as our goal and our target. I think that as   we are pretty early on in the strategy but as we execute against   that strategy we will continue to evaluate and assess the growth   rate, the long-term growth targets that we provide to you. If   there are opportunities to increase these, we certainly will. We   also will wanna make sure we provide you insight into the   investments we are making, particularly in R&D that are   focused on our strategy so that we can provide you an update and   measures for you to be able to understand how we're progressing   against these investment areas. We will continue to provide, and   probably provide a little bit more disclosure in the future just   to round our R&D activities. Generally speaking, our goal is   to make sure that we can deliver on that double-digit total   shareholder return, and we hope to be able to do that with   increased growth over time as we execute against our   strategy.   Rich Repetto    --   Sandler O'Neill & Partners -- Analyst   Great. Thank you very much.     Operator   Thank you. Our next question is from Chris Harris with Wells   Fargo. You may begin.   Chris Harris    --   Wells Fargo -- Analyst   Thanks, guys. Two questions on market structure. One,   wondering if you guys are supportive of a pilot to examine the   impact of reduced access fees. Then related to that, if   Maker/Taker went away, what do you think would be the impact on   your business?   Adena T. Friedman    --   President, Chief Executive Officer, COO, and Director   In terms of the access fee pilot, what we've discussed, and   we've said in public testimony is we are willing to work with the   SEC on an access fee pilot. We tried to do it without the SEC   involvement a couple years ago, but the other exchanges didn't   choose to participate in that, so it's hard to get any meaningful   results out of it. I would say that we are willing to work,   certainly, with the SEC to implement an access fee pilot. We have   expressed some real concern around the access fees as it applies   to smaller company stocks and the need for market makers to have   proper incentives to post quotes and be involved in those stocks.   We are pretty adamant about our concern around that. How they   construct the pilot, how long they run it, how many stocks are   involved, which stocks are involved? Are gonna be very important   to working with them on that. I do believe that there are...It seems like it's something that they are interested in   trying to do and we will work with them if that's their decision.   In terms of the impact of elimination of access fees, this has   been a part of our market. It's integrated and integral to Reg.   and MF. To the extent that there is a review of Reg. and MF, and   all of the market structure components there that certainly   looking at access fees could be a part of that over the long run.   But elimination of access fees, we don't really try to predict   the impact of that, I think it is an integral part of our market   structure today, and it likely will continue to be with the pilot   giving us some information as to the impact of that over   time.   Chris Harris    --   Wells Fargo -- Analyst   Thanks a lot.     Operator   Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeremy Campbell with   Barclays. You may begin.   Jeremy Campbell    --   Barclays -- Analyst   Hey, thanks.Just a quick question on your info services. Thanks for the   incremental disclosure here, I think it's gonna be useful for   folks. Just thinking big picture, in your entire info services   complex but maybe especially in the proprietary U.S. Equities   stuff that is under scrutiny here, how much of the top-line   growth in the past was from price increases, and with the focus   here on this vertical, what do you think the outlook is for price   increases going forward on this business?   Adena T. Friedman    --   President, Chief Executive Officer, COO, and Director   Overall, within our Information Services business, we have   given some clarity on that in the past where we say somewhere in   the range of one to two percentage points of growth can come from   price increases in general. That does not pertain necessarily   specifically to each deed. We have, as you can tell, a very   diversified business. We work very closely with our clients and   with industry groups to understand how we're adding value to   these products, how the use of these products are changing, and   therefore we factored that into any pricing decisions we make.   That's a general comment across all of Information Services,   there are many times when we don't make increases in any   particular product we do it based on maybe changes and   enhancements, improvements that we made to the products and   changes and usage that would warrant a change in prices. That's   generally how we run the business.   Jeremy Campbell    --   Barclays -- Analyst   Thanks. But would it be fair to say that maybe instead of   wiping out this revenue stream like some people were kind of   doing, maybe it's more about the growth rate of this might be   slowing versus where it had been in the past given the U.S.   Treasury proposal?   Adena T. Friedman    --   President, Chief Executive Officer, COO, and Director   I would say that, as we said before, the U.S. Treasury   proposal, in our opinion is completely consistent with current   practice. And it's consistent with the current requirements that   the SEC places on broker-dealers for their best execution   obligations. We continue to support a mid-single digit growth   rate for the global information services business in the years to   come, that includes that the compliment of everything we do there   and are focused on growth in terms of our data analytics, the   growth in our index business, our focus on the buy side, and the   investment community, in addition to all the current products   that we support that supports our community.   Jeremy Campbell    --   Barclays -- Analyst   Great. Thank you.     Operator   Thank you. Our next question comes from Dan Fanon with   Jeffries. You may begin.   Dan Fannon    --   Jeffries -- Analyst   Thanks just a follow-up on the expenses and the outlook for   next year. I just wanna clarify, you talked about a 3% core   Nasdaq expense growth rate but that compares to roughly 1%, I   think you guys are tracking at this year. Then just the 6% number   I think you talked about on the combined businesses of eVestment   and Sybenetix, that's what you're gonna be spending just the core   growth of that business going forward versus any synergies or   anything that may be coming out.   Michael Ptasznik    --   President, Chief Executive Officer, COO, and Director   First of all, with the 3% relative to the 1%. The 3%   represents the historical growth rate we typically see in the   four synergies. This year, the 1% on a year-to-date basis really   does take into account the synergies we have for acquisitions,   and the flow-through of that into this year. So, 3% would be a   normal organic growth rate over the last few years before the   synergies.With respect to the 6%, that 6% does reflect the combination   of Sybenetix and eVestment the year-over-year approximate   increase due to those acquisitions and what that impact would be,   it includes the run rate, the growth that we expect behind those   businesses. As we said, we believe that eVestment will continue   to drive growth as well as Sybenetix obviously. Additionally, as   we disclosed here, there are some up-front integration costs for   retention compensation and some other things that we're gonna be   spending.When we announced the eVestment deal we did talk about how   there will be some synergies in the business and they will be   offset by some additional expenses that we'll be spending. Some   of that is just with respect to timing. Some of the up-front   costs obviously have to accrue now, and then the synergies would   come at a future period.   Dan Fannon    --   Jeffries -- Analyst   Got it. Thank you.     Operator   Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Carrier with   Bank of America. You may begin.   Sameer Murukutla    --   Bank of America -- Analyst   Hey. Good morning Adena, Michael. This is Sameer Murukutla on   for Michael Carrier. I want to focus more on the market   technology segment. I think you highlighted the growth and the   [inaudible] [00:35:19]    effort. Can you just give us more detail on this initiative, what   kind of growth rate you're seeing? Who you primarily are   competing with? Is this really being reflected in the backlog   order intake? I guess it didn't move up as much as we expected on   a quarter-to-quarter basis.   Adena T. Friedman    --   President, Chief Executive Officer, COO, and Director   And you're asking the question across the whole segment. I   just wanna make sure.   Sameer Murukutla    --   Bank of America -- Analyst   Yes.   Adena T. Friedman    --   President, Chief Executive Officer, COO, and Director   Okay.I think that in terms of the overall growth of Market Tech,   where we continue to see very strong demand is frankly existing   clients taking on more of our services, and some new clients   signing up to take our services particularly in a post-trade area   and the surveillance and risk management areas, as well as some   as some new trading clients that we've been able to attract this   year. Then I would say that in our surveillance area. The Smart   Surveillance business continues to be a high grower for us. All   of those pieces are included in order intake and order backlog. I   think that in the third-quarter you do have some vacation   periods, it does slow down some of our clients from making   decisions, but we have had some really good wins this quarter,   most notably having a tier one bank choose us to develop their   foreign exchange trading system in addition to some post-trade   wins with our clients. We are continuing to see very strong   demand dynamics within the business. We do believe that the order   backlog does reflect the potential for us to continue to show   good organic growth in that business. We continue to have great   dialog with our clients as we roll out the Nasdaq financial   framework and other new services that will expand what we can do   for them.   Michael Ptasznik    --   Chief Financial Officer, EVP Corporate Strategy   As we mentioned on other calls, as more the business continues   to convert toward more of a sass recurring business, the order   backlog number is maybe not as representative as it has been in   the past. We will be revisiting those measures in the future to   try to provide you with some additional color or some alternative   measures to help see how the growth of the business is coming   on.   Sameer Murukutla    --   Bank of America -- Analyst   Thanks for the color.     Operator   Thank you. Our next question comes from Brian Bedell with   Deutsche Bank. You may begin.   Brian Bedell    --   Deutsche Bank -- Analyst   Adena, maybe just a little bit more on the regulatory side of   things. You mentioned obviously the relook at the Reg. NMF. I   guess reasonably in your view, how long would it take. It's   always tough to obviously gauge regulators, but how long do you   think it would take to run through the pilot programs and the   process of gauging how effective the pilots were and actually   changing any kind of rules on market structure and also same   thing on the market data set. Obviously, Tom Whitman and Tom   Farley put a letter together with some concerns on the access fee   pilot. Just trying to gauge the timing of how long that whole   process might take, and to what extent that would impact your   business in the much more distant future than in the   near-term.   Adena T. Friedman    --   President, Chief Executive Officer, COO, and Director   Our regulatory process, particularly SEC rulemaking, is a   robust process, it goes through an extensive common period, it   goes through a lot of debates and discussions. I can't predict   how long that type of process could take but in prior   experiences, it's been multi-year experience to try to look at   significant changes in market structure at the SEC. What I'm   pleased about is that it does go through a robust process. They   have to go through an economic review. They have to seek comments   from the industry. They allow the industry to have deep dialog   with the staff and with the commission. They do this in a way   that's very overt and open to public comment as well so that   everyone understands the process as it unfolds. It is a long   process and for good reason. These are important decisions to   make. They're important to our U.S. capital market, and to the   way that the system works. They are integrated and integral, it's   hard to take one part of a system and change it without having   consequences to other parts of the system. It is really important   for them to be very careful in considering them. I think they   are. My experience has been, over many years working with the   SEC, has been they do take these things very seriously and they   go through a very robust process. I can't predict specific times,   but it generally is a multi-year process.   Brian Bedell    --   Deutsche Bank -- Analyst   That's great color. Maybe back on the strategic review for the   public relations and digital media, obviously you'll announce   something when you have something, but if we were to assume that   business is sold given the revenue and operating income metrics,   895 million of revenue, I think that's about 13% or so of your   nearly 1.5 billion of non-trading revenue, can you give us a   sense of the growth rate of that piece of business and assuming   that's lower growth that would automatically enhance your   non-trading revenue, and then as you pivot toward investments in   some of the faster growth segments can we see some upside to that   mid-single digit overall non-trading revenue long-term growth   profile?   Adena T. Friedman    --   President, Chief Executive Officer, COO, and Director   The PR and the digital media businesses have been slow to no   growers essentially. They're not growth areas for us. I think   that part of that is because we focus very much on the IR   component of those businesses because, of course, that's our   inclination. Using those services to interact with the capital   markets and manage the public company components of working the   capital markets. I think that we are finding that we have a   better opportunity to use our skills, our expertise and our   strategic relationships with our clients to a more on the   intelligence side, the IR insight, the advisory business, the   state board and leadership businesses. Those are higher IR   business as a general matter than the PR and digital media   businesses. In terms of the pivot, the goal of our strategic   review is to find ways to elevate our growth rates to push   ourselves toward the higher growth businesses and as we execute   against that strategy, as I said earlier, we really do, we will   be looking to assess our growth rates and provide you updated   guidance. Our long-term, medium-term outlook, I think is what we   call it, in terms of our revenue growth rates as we execute   against that strategy and to the extent that we have completed   the strategic review there and we've got eVestment inside our   organization, those will be the types of things that would drive   us to reassess our growth rates.   Brian Bedell    --   Deutsche Bank -- Analyst   That's more like a next year potential change in that?   Adena T. Friedman    --   President, Chief Executive Officer, COO, and Director   We are in the middle of execution today, so we'll see how   things go.   Brian Bedell    --   Deutsche Bank -- Analyst   Okay. Okay. Fair enough. Thank you.     Operator   Thank you. Our next question comes from Alex Blostein with   Goldman Sachs. You may begin.   Alex Blostein    --   Goldman Sachs -- Analyst   Great. Thanks. Good morning everybody.Just a couple follow-ups around the operating leverage   discussion. One specific question and one broader-picture   question.On the specific side, looking at market tech, this obviously   remains a faster growth area for Nasdaq. It sounds like you guys   are going through near-term investments but the margins are in   the 20-21% range for the last couple quarters. How long do you   guys think the elevated investments, then, will persist and how   should we think about incremental margin, expansion opportunities   in that particular segment?Then I guess the follow-up on a broader side of things.   Michael, taking your comments around expectations for expenses   for next year, obviously too early to be too explicit, but can   Nasdaq deliver operating leverage next year, assuming   mid-single-digit revenue growth rates that you've targeted in the   past. Thanks   Adena T. Friedman    --   President, Chief Executive Officer, COO, and Director   With regard to market tech, I think that we are making some   very good investments in the technology. As a technology   business, you always have to have some investment dollars. I   think we have had some concentrated investments with Nasdaq   Financial Framework and some real investment in the Smart   Surveillance business and some of the new capabilities we're   bringing there. I think that will continue to have an impact on   the expenses of the business in the near-term as you mentioned. I   think the question is can we deliver that into a more scalable   business going forward? That is most certainly the goal.As Michael mentioned, we are moving more of our revenue toward   the sass model, our current license model, and trying to make it   so that we also have more hosted solutions over time. We do   believe that also will give us more operating leverage in that   business. We do definitely have opportunities with these   investments we're making to create operating leverage in that   business. But it will always be an area that we invest in because   there's always new technologies we can apply and provide to our   clients. I think that's a general answer on the market tech.You wanna answer the extent question, Michael?   Michael Ptasznik    --   Chief Financial Officer, EVP Corporate Strategy   Yes. I would say with respect to whether there is gonna be   margin extension or not, obviously, that is the goal over the   medium to long-term of the organization to continue to, as Adena   said, drive double-digit TSR, continue to grow the business. Grow   the top line at a faster rate than the expenses which should   drive that margin expansion. In a year-over-year basis, we don't   give margin goals on a year-over-year basis, but that is the goal   that we would have as an organization over the medium-term.There's a number of things coming into next year, like the   eVestment, we talked about the impact of eVestment of the revenue   impact, the acquisition there, what ended up happening with   strategic review. There's a lot of moving pieces with respect to   next year, and we don't provide that short-term guidance. The   focus is driving TSR and margin expansion over medium to   long-term.   Alex Blostein    --   Goldman Sachs -- Analyst   Got it. Alright. Fair enough. Thanks, guys.     Operator   Thank you. Our next question comes from Vincent Hung with   Autonomous.   Vincent Hung    --   Autonomous -- Analyst   Hi. Just a question on the Sip. The Sip has seen numerous   improvements in recent years. Incidentally in latency. Given   these improvements did you ever see any impact on your   proprietary data business? I'm just trying to understand where   the meaningful improvements in the Sip could lead customers to   find their proprietary data is redundant.   Adena T. Friedman    --   President, Chief Executive Officer, COO, and Director   Advance have not seen any impact on the demand for our   proprietary data in relation to the improvements we've made in   the Sip and the latency there. I think that people see them as   serving two different needs. The Sip obviously is the basis for   best execution, it's the foundation for interacting with the   capital markets. The depth allows for companies to have a lot of   different strategies that they undertake to interact with this   capital market, or to give clients just a bigger and better   picture of the market. We generate revenue, as you can see, in   our depth seeds across a whole range of clients. You've got   non-professional users that get a chance to see depth through   their    online   broker    s, you've got professional institutional users that are using it   to really get a sense of where the market is and where it's   going. Then you also have the professional traders who are using   it to actually interact and execute on strategies in the market.   We have not seen any shift in the demand characteristics as a   result of improving the Sip latency.   Vincent Hung    --   Autonomous -- Analyst   Great. Thanks.     Operator   Thank you. Our next question comes from Ben Herbert with Citi.   You may begin.   Ben Herbert    --   Citi -- Analyst   Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question.   Adena T. Friedman    --   President, Chief Executive Officer, COO, and Director   Sure.   Ben Herbert    --   Citi -- Analyst   Just on eVestment. Could you provide a little more color on   the competitive position and how that might change or improve   plugged into your platform?   Adena T. Friedman    --   President, Chief Executive Officer, COO, and Director   I would say that eVestment today has a very strong competitive   position. Bjorn Sevrn, who leads our information services   business has been working very closely on the integration   planning with the eVestment team. We continue to be incredibly   impressed with the business, with the interactions they have with   their clients, with the level of distribution and penetration   they have in the industry and the unique nature of how they bring   the information together, and the analytics they can provide to   every aspect of the investment management community. They have a   very strong competitive position. I would say they are relatively   unique in how the data that they've been collecting, the   penetration in the market, and the analytics that they generate.   We would expect that our synergies with them are that we can   probably bring even more advanced analytics to the data that they   have. We have our mutual fund flotation service and we would   expect to integrate that and potentially get more penetration of   that services through their clients. We have the potential to   create new indices and other data products that are more   generally available based on the public data that they collect.   We just see great opportunity and synergy between the business to   increase distribution but also to deepen our relationships with   the investment management community.   Ben Herbert    --   Citi -- Analyst   Thanks.Maybe just a quick follow-up on Sybenetix. That $805 million   backlog, would that include any backlog related to Sybenetix?   Adena T. Friedman    --   President, Chief Executive Officer, COO, and Director   What we've been saying is that the revenue... Sybenetix is a   small company today. It definitely will include the backlog from   Sybenetix going forward. But it doesn't suddenly create a   significant change in backlog upon the closure of the deal.   Ben Herbert    --   Citi -- Analyst   Great. Thank you.     Operator   Thank you. Our next question comes from Kyle Voigt with KBW.   You may begin.   Kyle Voigt     --   KBW -- Analyst   Hi. Good morning.Just first question on the strong growth in trade management   services. You sited in the slight increase in customer demand for   third-part connectivity and co-lo. We don't have any underlying   stats on how the number of subscribers or users of these products   has changed over time, but I'm wondering if you could help us   bridge the gap between the higher customer demand that you're   seeing for connectivity with, on the other side, continue   consolidation of market makers, and high-frequency traders and   that consolidating trend seeming to accelerate more recently.   Adena T. Friedman    --   President, Chief Executive Officer, COO, and Director   We are, generally speaking, the client base in our TMS   business has increased over time. We continue to see new   participants actually coming in and asking for connectivity in   addition to the acquisitions create a counter-trend to that in   some regards. But frankly, we continue to have active sign-up and   new clients coming in to support the TMS business. It's   basically, in terms of also the growth that we've gotten from   Tri-EX and the Icea Integrations also have contributed to growth   in that business as well.   Kyle Voigt     --   KBW -- Analyst   As a follow-up on a prior question on the Treasury report.   Specifically, the question related to the Sip. One of the   recommendations was to move to a consolidator model to provide   alternatives to the Sip. I know it's a relatively broad   recommendation and not many details were in the recommendation, I   'm just trying to understand how you would envision that model   playing out, and how it could potentially impact the Sip data   revenue pool for the industry as well as maybe some other product   that you have that already compete with the Sips such as Nasdaq   Basic?   Adena T. Friedman    --   President, Chief Executive Officer, COO, and Director   First of all, the multiple consolidator concept is not a new   concept at all. It's been a concept that the industry has been   discussing for a while. The UTP Committee has had that as an open   agenda item for a while. It's not a new concept. I think that, as   I said before, we have not objected to the concept of a multiple   consolidator model, so long as it does not place undue burden on   the broker-dealer community or the exchanges to create it. I   think that it is, just so understands, the Sip itself is its own   technology contract. Our market technology business has a   contract with UTP Committee to provide the Sip technology. In   terms of having potentially a competing Sip, that's fine. The   question is who would ultimately pay for that? But that is not   related to the market data revenue itself. The market data   revenue itself and the pricing of that is done by the UTP   Committee and that would continue to be the case even if there   are multiple Sip distributing that data. I don't believe it would   have an impact on the revenue, it would just create an   alternative to the Sip. I think there have been discussions on   multiple consolidators or just a distributed Sip model, and we've   had, I think, productive dialog on both of those ideas over   time.   Kyle Voigt     --   KBW -- Analyst   Thank you.     Operator   Thank you. Our next question comes from Alex Cram with UBS.   You may begin.   Alex Kramm    --   UBS -- Analyst   Hey. Good morning.Coming back to that regulation topic that we've been debating   all day here. I think the bigger reason why we're having this   debate is obviously because broker-dealer's customers are now   facing a hard time in seeing non-transaction cost as U.S.   equities go higher. That doesn't obviously not just include   market data, but also includes things like connectivity,   co-location, port fees, etc. To Kyle's question just now, on the   trade management fees, which is, I think roughly $300 million per   year trailing, how much of that is U.S. equities, what's the   price and dynamics there? Are you getting a lot of questions or   headwinds from clients on that part of the business? I think it's   included in the bigger debate. So, maybe some more color.   Adena T. Friedman    --   President, Chief Executive Officer, COO, and Director   Our overall TMS business includes a lot of... It's also a very   diversified business and its support to a lot of different asset   classes. It also supports our trade reporting screen, other   things it is a diversified revenue stream itself. We do not   separately disclose the components of that revenue stream. I   think that generally speaking, the demand for overall cabinet,   ports, polo, things like that have been steady over time for the   U.S. equities markets. We've had growth in that business coming   from some of the acquisitions, as I mentioned with TRIEX and ISE   and earlier with eSpeed. I think that we are growing by having   more exchanges, more asset classes traded through our data   center. In addition to having connectivity for equities and I   would say a variety of different connectivity choices that we   offer to all our clients across asset classes. I would say this,   Alex, it's a very steady business, we work very productively with   our clients, we continue to have new customers signing up for   certain services and connectivity into equities in addition to   other asset classes. It's been a nice, strong part of our   business.   Alex Kramm    --   UBS -- Analyst   Fair enough then just very quickly for Michael.Did you point out audit fees this quarter? I think in the   press release you said it was a driver. But what's the number   this quarter?   Michael Ptasznik    --   President, Chief Executive Officer, COO, and Director   It was 8 million this quarter, it was 4 million the same   quarter a year ago.   Alex Kramm    --   KBW -- Analyst   Perfect. Thank you.     Operator   Thank you. Our next question comes from Patrick O'Shaughnessy   with Raymond James. You may begin.   Patrick O'Shaughnessy    --   Raymond James -- Analyst   Hey good morning.I was hoping you could provide an update on the U.S. listings   compared environment I think both in terms of battling against   the established competitor for some of the biggest IPOs and then   battling against the new entrant in the spaces offering to waive   five years of listings fees.   Adena T. Friedman    --   President, Chief Executive Officer, COO, and Director   First of all, we are really pleased with how the listings have   developed as we've gone through the year. As we mentioned, a   third quarter, we had a 77% win-rate. We've had some great   companies come and access the public markets over the quarter. We   continue to see a really nice strong pipeline of listings as we   go through the rest of the year. It does feel like the overall   environment is picking up and we're doing well competitively and   winning IPOs and having some great companies choose to have   Nasdaq as their home. We're pretty pleased with how the dynamics   are developing there. In terms of just overall competition, we   compete vigorously for every IPO, we compete vigorously on   getting companies to switch from our competitors to Nasdaq and we   continue to find success in that area as well. We respect all   competitors and new entrants. We do wanna make sure that our   clients are existing clients and any new clients fully understand   the breadth and depth of Nasdaq as a listing exchange partner and   the value proposition that we offer. I think we do believe that   we have the best value proposition out there. We feel very good   about how things are developing right now.   Patrick O'Shaughnessy    --   Raymond James -- Analyst   Got it. Thanks.For my follow-up. You touched on this a little bit in your   prepared remarks, but can you expand on some of the ways that you   might you might be able to leverage your eVestment client   relationships to provide more services or products to active   asset managers.   Adena T. Friedman    --   President, Chief Executive Officer, COO, and Director   The core of their business today are active asset managers in   addition to alternatives and over time, some more focus on the   passive investors as well. We do want to make sure that we look   at how we can leverage the relationships they have there, the   platform, the delivery mechanism to bring them more analytics   that would help them manage their investment strategies in   addition to making them competitive with each other. I think we   are just at the beginning of our planning stages around that but   that certainly is part of the strategy.   Patrick O'Shaughnessy    --   Raymond James -- Analyst   Great. Thank you.     Operator   Thank you. Once again, ladies and gentlemen, if you wish to   ask a question at this time please press star, then one on your   touchtone telephone.I'm currently showing no further questions at this time. I'd   like to turn the call back over to Adena Friedman for closing   remarks.   Adena T. Friedman    --   President, Chief Executive Officer, COO, and Director   Great. Thank you very much.I think that as we look at all the advancements and the strong   third-quarter results we feel that they have been achieved by   advancing our core franchises competitive position coupled with   driving growth in our technology, information and analytics   businesses. The strategy that we articulated today will continue   to gain momentum as we integrate the acquisitions, invest in our   future, and conclude our strategic reviews and our refined CAP   allocation and continued focus on double-digit shareholder return   will help ensure that our team and our shareholders remain   aligned in the quarters and years ahead. With that, thank you   very much and I look forward to speaking with you all soon....     Operator   Ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference.

2017-01-23,Navient (NAVI) to Report Q4 Earnings: What's in the Cards?,"Navient Corporation  NAVI  is scheduled to report fourth-quarter and full-year 2016 results tomorrow, after market close.   You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they're reported with our Earnings ESP Filter  .        Zacks ESP   : The Earnings ESP for Navient is -2.27%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate of 43 cents stands below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 44 cents.        Zacks Rank   : Navient's Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) further lowers the predictive power of ESP. We caution investors against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or #5 (Sell-rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement.     What to Expect?         Revenues   : The student loans market has turned into one of the biggest consumer debt markets of the nation. Though conditions in the financial markets have been challenging lately, Navient's consistent efforts to acquire student loan portfolios, both Federally Guaranteed Student Loans (FFELP) as well as Private Education Loans, should lend some support to the quarterly results.     Further, the company's efforts to grow asset recovery revenues, with focus beyond student loan platforms, should support revenues at its business services segment. However, the quarter might reflect lower revenues due to decrease in education loan-related asset recovery volume, mostly tied with the Department of Education contract which expired in Feb 2015.     Management had guided business services revenues in between $620 million and $650 million for the year.    Expenses   : Navient's several ongoing initiatives to improve efficiency should ease the expense burden. However during the third quarter earnings call conference, management noted that due to shift of $2.7 billion of Navient-owned  FFELP loans to Navient servicing platform during the fourth-quarter, the company would incur an additional $7 million of one-time operating expenses in the quarter. Nevertheless, management expects operating expenses below $930 million for 2016.        Margins   : FFELP net interest margin (NIM) is expected to remain in the low to mid 80s for full-year 2016 and in the low 80s for the fourth quarter. Private student loan NIM is expected to be in the mid-340s for the year, and is projected to be in the low 320s in the fourth quarter. The guidance was based on management's assumptions tied with updated repayment, cost of funds from its LIBOR based debt and no rise in the prime rate during the fourth quarter.     Due to the impact of the LIBOR basis risk and the additional one-time $7 million expense, management expects EPS (earnings per share) to be at the midpoint of the $1.82 to $1.87 range for 2016.     Navient's activities during the quarter were inadequate to win analysts' confidence. As a result, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter remained stable at 44 cents over the last seven days. The estimates reflect a year-over-year decline of 9%.     Stocks that Warrant a Look      Here are some stocks worth considering, as they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.     Nasdaq, Inc. NDAQ  is scheduled to release results on Jan 31. It has an Earnings ESP of +1.06% and carries a Zacks Rank #3.     CME Group Inc. CME  is slated to release results on Feb 2.

2018-07-09,IEX hires former ISE executive Ilyevsky to lead market development,"NEW YORK, July 9 (Reuters) - U.S. stock exchange operator IEX Group said on Monday it has hired Boris Ilyevsky, a former long-time executive of the options-focused International Securities Exchange (ISE), to lead market development, including a potential expansion into options.Ilyevsky, who spent 17 years at ISE before it was bought by Nasdaq Inc  for $1.1 billion from Deutsche Boerse  in 2016, will help IEX explore ""potential opportunities for strategic diversification,"" the company said in a statement.""I'm looking forward to using my industry experience and looking critically at markets where IEX could make a major impact by providing a fair and unconflicted choice,"" Ilyevsky said.""Flash Boys"" focused on IEX's founders as they sought to create what they deemed a fairer marketplace for investors, utilizing a so-called speed bump that slowed down stock orders with the aim of preventing predatory trading practices. Other exchanges initially opposed the speed bump, though some later adopted or proposed versions of their own.But market share growth at IEX, which unlike most of its rivals does not pay rebates to brokers that send it orders, stalled out at around 2.5 percent.Ilyevsky, who oversaw the launch and development of two new equity derivatives markets while at ISE, will consider a number of broad areas for potential expansion by IEX, including the options market, IEX President Ronan Ryan said in a statement to Reuters.""But we have no plans to enter that market at this point,"" Ryan said, referring to the options market.IEX has also said it plans to start a corporate listings program this year, in a challenge to the Nasdaq and the New York Stock Exchange, which is owned by Intercontinental Exchange Inc.

2018-01-29,3 Top Tech Stocks to Buy Right Now,"There's no shortage of technology companies on Wall Street,   but it can be hard to nail down which companies are the best   long-term bets when there are so many to choose from. Even   if you find a company you like, it can be hard to know   when    it's the right time to invest.To help you find great tech stocks that you should consider   buying right now, we asked three Motley Fool contributors for   their top tech stock picks. They came back with   Atlassian    (NASDAQ: TEAM) ,   Okta    (NASDAQ: OKTA) and   PayPal Holdings    (NASDAQ: PYPL) . Read on to find out more.           Image source: Getty Images.        Todd Campbell       (    Atlassian):    I admit it. I'm a sucker for fast-growing companies like   Atlassian that are already turning a profit.In fact, I'm disappointed it's taken me so long to come around   to recommending Atlassian. The company's been one of the market's   top-performing stocks, yet its top- and bottom-line growth   suggest that it may still only be early innings for it.Atlassian's wheelhouse is collaboration software, and its   revenue and profitability benefit from a margin-friendly,   subscription business model. In its   recently reported    fiscal second quarter, revenue jumped 43% year over year to   $212.6 million, and leveraging sales growth against fixed costs   translated into adjusted net income of $31 million, up   from $21.7 million last year. On a per-share basis,   that works out to $0.13 in fiscal Q2, up from $0.09 one year   ago.What's driving this company's success? An increasingly larger   and more engaged subscribership. As low unemployment rates make   it more difficult to boost productivity through hiring, more   employers are   turning to software    solutions to increase productivity. That's great news for   Atlassian because it means more interest in its project tracking,   content creation and sharing, real-time communication, and   service management solutions.Overall, I don't dismiss that this stock's valuation has   gotten rich, but as a long-term investor, I'm not that worried   about its current valuation given the opportunities for this   company to grow. It added 4,825 new customers globally last   quarter, bringing its customer count to over 112,000, which is   more than double its customer count two years ago. Its goal is to   serve the entire Fortune 5,000, and as its customer count   increases and cross-selling grows those relationships, I expect   sales and earnings upside will eventually trump worry over its   high P/E ratio.                 Jeremy Bowman       (Okta):    Everybody knows the FAANG stocks by now, and there's been no   shortage of opportunities with tech stocks as the   Nasdaq     jumped 28% last year compared to a 19% increase in   S&P 500    .But if you're looking for an under-the-radar stock that has   the potential to deliver big returns, Okta fits the bill. If   you've ever gotten frustrated with internet passwords, you can   see why Okta is only becoming more important. The company is the   leading independent provider of what it calls ""identity for the   enterprise,"" or ensuring secure connections to the internet and   other tech platforms. With its trademark product, the Okta   Identity Cloud, the company is sitting on two big long-term   trends in tech, the cloud and cybersecurity, and as its Identity   Cloud gets bigger, the company will increasingly benefit from   network effects.The company was founded in 2009,   went public    last year, and now has more than two million daily users, which   include individuals in companies like 20th Century Fox,   Adobe    , and Linkedin, as well as universities, non-profits, and   government agencies.Okta is not yet profiable, but revenue has been growing   briskly as sales more than doubled in fiscal 2016 and jumped   another 87% in fiscal 2017. In its most recent quarter, revenue   increased 61%, and free cash flow margins are improving. Okta has   also beat analyst earnings estimates in all three of its reports   as a publicly traded company.With hacking and security breaches a fact of modern digital   life, Okta's relevance should only grow as the need for   cybersecurity does as well. The identity security specialist   should have a long tail of growth ahead of it.        Chris Neiger       (PayPal):    It's hard not to get excited about the direction PayPal is   heading in. The company is, of course, a leader in online digital   payment processing, but it's also a financially strong company   that's made huge moves in the peer-to-peer payment market as   well.The company ended its third quarter of 2017 with 8.2 million   more active accounts (with 218 million total now) and increased   sales by 21%. The quarter marked consistent growth for PayPal's   top line and added to the company's already-fantastic balance   sheet of no debt and about $10 billion in cash. To top it   all off, PayPal beat Wall Street's consensus earnings estimates   three times in 2017    .PayPal's done a fantastic job of building out new partnerships   on its platform, which has helped lead to its growth. For   example, the company's partnership with   Facebook    allows social media users to send payments to each other through   Facebook Messenger.But it's the company's opportunities in peer-to-peer (P2P)   payments that are the most exciting right now. PayPal bought the   popular social payment company Venmo back in 2015, and over the   past 12 months ending in September, Venmo used the app to send   $30 billion in payments, a jump of 106% year over year. That's   great news for PayPal considering that the mobile P2P payments   market will worth an estimated $244 billion in just three years,   up from $120 billion last year.The company is starting to monetize Venmo by allowing users to   pay a small fee to get their funds faster, and by charging   merchants for Venmo transactions. PayPal's   growth from its core payment processing   business    , along with its opportunities from Venmo, make the company a top   tech stock to consider right now. With all of those prospects --   and a great balance sheet -- PayPal looks like a great tech stock   with long-term potential.

2017-02-24,"CME's Trading Volumes Down In January, Expected To Rise With Oil And Metal Volatility","Metals have continued to be in demand, with over 30% growth in volumes. This is because of increased volatility in the market from the continuous shift in gold and  silver prices  due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar and other economic and political factors in the U.S. We expect the volatility to remain in the near term, driving metal derivative volumes.We expect the oil market to remain volatile as well, as OPEC's indications on further capping of the oil supply could drive oil prices. This will consequently have a positive influence on the energy derivative volumes.Interest rate derivatives are expected to pick up in pace with the possibility of a series of rate hikes by the Fed in 2017.

2017-05-18,Which Stock Index Should You Invest In?,"A    stock index    is a way to evaluate the performance of part or all of the stock   market, typically by assessing the average behavior of the stocks   that make up that index. But stock indices aren't just useful as   a measurement tool; they can be a powerful investment tool as   well.Index mutual funds and ETFs seek to mirror the performance of   a particular stock index by holding the stocks that make up that   index. Because the index simply tracks a certain set of stocks,   there's much less need for the fund manager to get actively   involved in trading decisions, so fees and commissions are   typically far lower than fees and commissions in an ""actively   managed"" mutual fund -- and index funds have far fewer   transactions as well, meaning you'll save on capital gains   taxes.All in all, deciding to go with an index fund is the easy   part; the challenge is figuring out which index would be the best   one for you to follow. Here's a list of some of the most   significant indices and why you might want to choose each.The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES: ^DJI) is one of   the oldest stock indices and is still one of the most widely used   today. It tracks the stocks of 30 of the largest and most   influential businesses in the US, which currently includes Apple,   ExxonMobil, McDonald's, and Walt Disney.The Dow is a price-weighted index, meaning that component   stocks with higher share prices are given more weight than the   lower-priced stocks. Because the Dow consists entirely of very   large, established businesses, it's a good choice to follow for   someone who is looking for blue-chip companies to invest in. The   Dow makes up roughly 1/4th of the entire US stock market, and it   tends to fluctuate in sync with the market as a whole.           Image source: Getty images.The NASDAQ (NASDAQ: NDAQ) is a stock exchange that emphasizes   technology stocks, and the Nasdaq Composite Index includes every   stock on this exchange.Unlike the Dow, it's a market-capitalization-weighted index,   meaning that the stocks in this index are weighted by the total   dollar value of each company's shares. Thus, bigger companies are   given more weight than smaller ones.Like the exchange it's based on, the Nasdaq Composite Index   has a heavy emphasis on technology and biotech stocks, but also   includes some stocks from other sectors, including financial,   transportation, and industrial stocks. It also includes some       penny stocks    . Thus, an index fund following the Nasdaq Composite Index will   do well when the technology sector as a whole thrives. If you're   looking for a fund based on the technology sector, this index is   a good one to choose.The first-ever index fund (the Vanguard 500 Index Fund   (NYSEMKT: VOO)) used the S&P 500 as its index. The S&P   500 tracks the performance of 500 of the most widely traded   stocks in the United States and makes up about 80% of the value   of the entire US stock market.This index is a market-capitalization-weighted index, and   includes stocks from a wide range of sectors. The S&P 500   tends to move in line with the market as a whole even more   closely than the Dow, so it's a great choice for investors   looking for an index that will mirror the entire US stock   market's behavior.The Russell 2000 (RUSSELLINDICES:^RUT) index is a subset of   the Russell 3000 index. The Russell 3000 tracks the largest   publicly traded companies in the US market; the Russell 2000   tracks the 2000 smallest companies within the Russell 3000. Thus,   the Russell 2000 index has become a widely used benchmark for the   performance of smaller US companies, also known as small-cap   stocks.Small-caps tend to be more volatile than large-caps, but they   also tend to perform slightly better over the long haul. An   investor looking for an index fund or ETF that will have slightly   higher risk but will maximize potential returns should consider   one following the Russell 2000 index.The MSCI EAFE (NYSEARCA: EFA), unlike the previously mentioned   indices, tracks the stocks of non-US- based companies.   Specifically, it tracks stocks of companies based in Europe,   Australasia, and the Far East. This index includes the most   developed regions outside of North America, with countries that   tend to have stable governments and economies in line with the   US's. Thus, index funds that track this index provide a   relatively low-risk way to invest internationally.Diversification is the key to minimizing risk and maximizing   returns over the long haul. Investing in index funds rather than   individual stocks is a step in the right direction, but you can   diversify further by choosing two or three different indices to   invest in.Selecting indices that reflect widely varying types of stocks   will help protect you from poor performance in one sector or   region of the market. For example, choosing a Dow index fund and   an S&P 500 index fund won't really help you diversify because   those indices tend to behave similarly. But if you choose a Dow   index fund and a Russell 2000 index fund, you'll be doing a much   better job at diversifying: the Dow tracks very large companies   while the Russell 2000 tracks small-cap companies. Throw in an   international index fund as well, and your diversification will   become global. Whatever the economy throws at you, such a   well-diversified portfolio will help you to survive   unscathed.          The $16,122 Social Security bonus most retirees     completely overlook            If you're like most Americans, you're a few years (or more)     behind on your retirement savings. But a handful of     little-known ""Social Security secrets"" could help ensure a     boost in your retirement income. For example: one easy trick     could pay you as much as $16,122 more... each year! Once you     learn how to maximize your Social Security benefits, we think     you could retire confidently with the peace of mind we're all     after.

2018-05-18,3 Ways Alternative Investments Are Going High Tech,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIt's easy to overlook the many advantages that technology has brought to individual investors. It was only back in 1971 that the first electronic stock exchange - the Nasdaq  - was launched. Then a few years later brokerage firms were allowed to charge different rates on commissions.Scrappy entrepreneurs like Charles Schwab understood the opportunities and created online platforms focused on convenience, wide access to information and lower fees.But of course, technology continues to move at a rapid pace, bringing more and more benefits to investors. As seen with booms in Artificial Intelligence or AI stocks like NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA ), there have been many recent technological breakthroughs. And these breakthroughs have been widespread, even affecting alternative investments and how investors can access them.So what can investors now to do leverage some of these technologies? Well, let's take a look at 3 high-tech alternative investments:It's tough to define ""robo advisor"" since there are many variations available on the market. Rather, it is easier to look at the general features. For example, a robo advisor is an automated system that asks you questions and process your financial information to develop an investment strategy, which is often based on sophisticated theories. Usually this involves putting money into ETFs (exchange-traded funds).But some robo advisors will provide access to a financial advisor, which can certainly be a big help when dealing with complicated issues. And hey, for now, computers have not replaced humans!Some of the well-known robo advisors include: Personal Capital , Betterment and Wealthfront . Many of these have the backing of venture capital firms.There are also robo advisors from some of the top financial services firms. Examples include Fidelity, Vanguard, TD Ameritrade Holding Corp. (NASDAQ: AMTD ), T. Rowe Price Group Inc (NASDAQ: TROW ) and Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE: SCHW ).Then which is the best for you? It's actually tough to provide a good answer. Rather, the best approach is to check out the websites of the services and then do some trials for those that look like a good fit for your investment needs.Yes, playing AI stocks can good be a way for investors to benefit from emerging trends. But then again, AI can also make investment decisions on your behalf.Consider BlackRock, Inc. (NYSE: BLK ). The firm recently launched a group of ETFs called "" iShares Evolved brand "" and they cover key segments like technology, financials, healthcare and consumer staples.These are passively managed portfolios - with twist. That is, BlackRock uses sophisticated AI and machine learning to select companies for the portfolio. This is done be scouring SEC filings and other content across the web.According to BlackRock : ""Anticipating change and challenging the status quo have always been at the heart of iShares' mission. That's why we've implemented a new way to classify companies - one that looks where they're going rather than where they've been.""If you make your own investment decisions, then AI and machine can help with the process. After all, success is often about getting a sense of the patterns and trends. And this is perfect for computers.Now there are various services that make claims about their capacity for machine learning. Yet there should be some skepticism. The fact is that the underlying technologies are usually not disclosed.Because of this, it is a good idea to focus on companies that have strong track records. And one to consider is Morningstar, Inc. (NASDAQ: MORN ), which has been around since 1984.Note that the company has recently launched the Morningstar Quantitative Rating, which is based on sophisticated machine learning algorithms. According to the company, the goal is to provide ""a forward-looking assessment of a fund's ability to outperform its peer group or a relevant benchmark on a risk-adjusted basis over a full market cycle.""The key is that this metric is for those funds that Morningstar does not have analysts to provide coverage. Essentially, machine learning is replicating human decision-making!The service is available at the following link, which includes a free trial .Tom Taulli is the author of  High-Profit IPO Strategies ,  All About Commodities  and  All About Short Selling . Follow him on Twitter at  @ttaulli . As of this writing, he did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.The post 3 Ways Alternative Investments Are Going High Tech appeared first on InvestorPlace .

2018-04-25,"Nasdaq open to cryptocurrency exchange in future, says CEO","By John McCrank and Nikhil SubbaApril 25 (Reuters) - Nasdaq Inc  is open to launching a cryptocurrency exchange in the future as the regulatory environment evolves, the head of the exchange operator said on Wednesday.The view that cryptocurrencies, such as bitcoin   will be a future way to support commerce is becoming more mainstream, Nasdaq's Chief Executive Officer, Adena Friedman, said in an interview following the announcement of better-than-expected quarterly earnings.""Over time, if it ultimately does morph into a regulated environment, it does give us an opportunity to participate as a marketplace, but I think that is a longer road and it doesn't have a certain path right now,"" she said.In the meantime, Nasdaq is exploring deals with several virtual currency exchanges to provide market infrastructure technology for trading and clearing, as well as surveillance, she said.Nasdaq on Wednesday announced a surveillance deal with Gemini Trust Company to monitor cryptocurrency trading on its exchange for potential market manipulation and fraud. EARNINGSNasdaq's net income in the first quarter rose to $177 million, or $1.05 per share, from $168 million, or 99 cents per share, a year earlier, helped by a volatility-driven spike in trading volumes. Stripping out special items, such as merger and acquisitions costs, the transatlantic exchange operator earned $1.24 per share, topping analysts' average estimates by four cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Volatility spiked in February after a prolonged calm in 2017, roiling global equities, bonds, currencies and commodities markets, and remained elevated through the end of March.Revenue rose 14.6 percent to $666 million. Revenue from market services, the company's largest business, jumped more than 21 percent to $735 million.Sales from Nasdaq's non-trading related businesses also grew, with revenue from its market technology unit rising 7.7 percent to $70 million, and revenue from information services up 26 percent at $174 million.Corporate services, which includes market listings, rose 7.5 percent to $172 million, as Nasdaq saw 37 IPOs in the quarter, including those of cloud storage company Dropbox  and Chinese video streaming platform iQiyi."

(NASDAQ: NDAQ)  was able to supplement decent top-line   growth with firm control of its overhead expenses in the third   quarter, as its earnings filing on Wednesday revealed. The   result? Some pretty impressive bottom-line numbers:     DATA SOURCE: NASDAQ Inc.Net revenue increased by $22 million versus the prior year       quarter, or roughly 4%, of which three percentage points were       due to organic growth, and one percentage point derived from       favorable foreign currency exchange rates.Nasdaq's operating expenses decreased by $9 million. This       drop can be traced directly to the company's lower ""merger       and strategic initiatives"" line item expense of $3 million,       against $12 million in the third quarter of 2016. However,       Nasdaq  also maintained a firm grip on all other general       and administrative expenses: Total operating expenses of $340       million matched the prior year's tally. This discipline       provided the operating leverage that resulted in the       company's 31% jump in diluted earnings per share (EPS).Market services, Nasdaq's largest segment at 36% of       revenue, reported a modest rise of $6 million in revenue to       $219 million, as gains in cash equities, fixed-income       trading, and trade management services were offset by a $5       million decline in equity derivatives revenue.Revenue in corporate services, Nasdaq's second-largest       segment at 26% of total revenue, dipped by $1 million to $161       million.The information services segment, which provides 25% of       company revenue, continued its recent strong performance,       gaining $13 million on the top-line to $150 million. The       growth was split evenly between data products and indexing       and licensing services.Market technology, which contributed 13% of revenue,       increased income by $4 million to $77 million. New order       intake of $66 million led to a 9% increase in total order       value versus 2016, equaling $805 million at quarter's       end.Nasdaq completed its roughly $700 million acquisition of       institutional analytics provider       eVestment        after the quarter ended. (The organization announced the       deal's closing this week.)The organization also completed its acquisition of       surveillance specialist       Sybenetix        for an undisclosed amount on Sept. 18. This was a relatively       small deal, paid for out of company cash; details will be       available when the company releases its 10-Q filing for the       quarter in a few days.The value of exchange traded product (ETP) assets under       management benchmarked to Nasdaq's index families increased       by 31% to $154 billion, pointing to the increasing popularity       of Nasdaq's indices as ETPs continue to gain favor over       mutual funds.                                            Image source: Getty Images.In Nasdaq's earnings release, CEO Adena Friedman discussed a   review of strategy that resulted in a reordering of company   priorities, in which data and analytics services to clients will   be emphasized:""...we completed a strategic review and initiated a business     pivot to move more of our resources behind our most sizable     growth opportunities. Initial actions supporting this new     direction include organic investment in our Market Technology     and Information Services businesses. Additionally, we completed     the acquisitions of eVestment and Sybenetix, and made the     decision to explore strategic alternatives for our Public     Relations Solutions and Digital Media Services businesses     within our Corporate Solutions business.""CFO Michael Ptasznik provided additional insight on the   strategy shift:""...we have refined our framework for deploying capital and     internal resources to support the growth objectives of our     fastest growing businesses, while remaining committed to     continuing our strong capital return track record. These     actions are expected to bolster our ability to deliver on our     double-digit total shareholder return target.""Both statements reflect the company's desire to diversify   revenue from its legacy trading base to software and information   services, while dispensing with business lines that won't   meaningfully impact growth or earnings.Nasdaq doesn't provide revenue or earnings guidance, but does   update changes on projected year-long expense. In its earnings   release, the company revised the bottom of its non-   GAAP     full-year expense range upward by $15 million, to $1.275   billion, leaving the top unchanged at $1.290 billion. The   increase is due to the closing of the eVestment and   Sybenetix transactions. After Nasdaq's admirable expense   discipline over the last three months, shareholders can expect   that it will hit this targeted range as closes out a profitable   year.          10 stocks we like better than Nasdaq            When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

2018-04-26,"Exchange operator CME's Group revenue misses, shares fall","April 26 (Reuters) - World's largest futures exchange operator CME Group Inc  narrowly missed analysts' estimates for first-quarter revenue on Thursday as a rise in lower rate contracts outweighed the benefits from a surge in overall trading volumes.The company also reported revenue decline in the market data business, a focus area, sending its shares down 3.2 percent to $155.71 in morning trade.In contrast, fellow-exchange operator Nasdaq Inc  on Wednesday reported a first-quarter profit and revenue that beat estimates on higher trading volumes. ""Rate per contract fell because there were higher volumes on lower priced products such as interest rate products,"" said Sandler O'Neill analyst Richard Repetto.Revenue from market data and information services fell 2 percent to $94.9 million.Argus Research analyst Stephen Biggar blamed the drop to a decline in the number of screens obtaining the data.Like other exchange operators, CME has been looking to build its non-trading related businesses such as its market data and information services.CME said average daily volume (ADV) jumped 30 percent to an all-time high of 22.2 million contracts, which pushed clearing and transaction fees, CME's biggest revenue stream, up 23 percent to $973.6 million.Exchanges booked gains in the first three months of 2018 after global equities, bonds, currencies and commodities markets were roiled by an increase in volatility in February that extended into March.Total revenue rose 19.3 percent to $1.11 billion, but missed estimate of $1.12 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.CME's net income rose to $598.8 million, or $1.76 per share, from $399.8 million, or $1.18 per share, a year earlier. On an adjusted basis, the company earned $1.86 per share, beating analysts' average estimate by 1 cent.Total expenses rose 12 percent to $368.1 million."
2018-04-24,Nasdaq (NDAQ) 1st Quarter Earnings: What to Expect,"Nasdaq (NDAQ) is set to report first quarter fiscal 2018 result before the opening bell Wednesday.After a record-breaking year last year, during which it reported four straight earnings beats, Nasdaq is looking to extend that momentum into 2018. Led by strong performances in Market Services, which accounts for almost 40% of total revenue, the New York-based company is enjoying higher revenues and growth across all segments of the business.With the share now trading near 52-week/all-time highs, reaching $87.66 on Monday, expectations are high, particularly if the company, which offers a broad range of services across various asset classes, continues to invests in areas such as technology to better diversify the business. To that end, a top- and bottom-line beat Wednesday, combined with confident guidance, will assuage investor fears about the costs these investments will incur.For the three months that ended March, Wall Street expects the Nasdaq to deliver adjusted earnings of $9.31 per share on revenue of $645.49 million. This compares to the year-ago quarter when earnings came to $1.11 per share on revenue of $583 million. For the full year, ending in December, earnings of $4.85 per share would rise 19.4% year over year, while full-year revenue of the $2.58 billion would rise 6.3% year over year.The company’s range of services which includes trading, clearing, derivatives, debt, commodities services (among many others) have driven record revenues over the past two years. During which, Nasdaq has delivered a compound annual growth rate of about 8%, owing to a combination of strategic expansion and organic growth initiatives.In the fourth quarter, the company delivered a profit of $246 million, yielding a net income of $1.45 per share, reversing last year’s loss of $224 million, or $1.35 per share. Revenue, excluding transaction-based expenses, rose 6% year over year to $635 million. Of which, some $7 million impact came from acquisitions, demonstrating the extent to which the company’s string of strategic deals, aimed at boosting the top line, continue to pay off.Together with $17 million, or 3% rise in organic growth and $12 million favorable impact from foreign exchange rates, lead to a Q4 revenue increase of $36 million from the same period a year ago. On Wednesday analysts will look to see the extent to which this level of growth can continue. Of note, Corporate Services revenue which in Q4 came to $170 million, accounting for 27% of total net revenues, is now Nasdaq’s second-largest business segment.Analysts will want confirmation that the company’s two main segments (Market Services and Corporate Services) can continue to flex its muscle. Elsewhere, analysts will focus on the first quarter subscription and recurring revenues, which has been growing high mid-single digits. All told, Nasdaq breeds higher expectations, particularly with synergies from strategic acquisitions still not yet full realized.

2018-03-14,Why Cloud Company Stocks Are Soaring,"The technology sector has reigned supreme over the last year.   With sectorwide returns of 24%, it outperformed the next best   sector, industrial goods, by 10 percentage points.           But within tech, it's the rise of cloud computing that's stolen   the spotlight.Cloud computing uses remote servers to store, deliver, and   manage data and applications over the Internet. It eliminates the   need for local servers and oftentimes the cumbersome installation   involving an IT department.Over the last year, the largest pure-play cloud companies have   left the   Nasdaq    behind. The slowest-growing of that group has more than doubled   the tech industry barometer; the fastest has   quintupled    the index's returns:                          NDAQ    data by   YCharts             So what's been driving cloud company stocks ever higher? And can   it continue? Let's take a closer look.           For starters, the wave of enthusiasm for tech stocks in general   has provided a tailwind. Consider that today, the four largest   companies in the world are all tech:   Apple    ,   Alphabet    ,   Amazon    , and   Microsoft    . Each of these is invested in the cloud, too, but largely   through storage; none of them are pure cloud businesses. This   differs from the software-as-a-service companies that I would   consider pure-play cloud companies.           The biggest players solely focused on the cloud are the ones   shown below, in order of   market capitalization    :   There are three reasons these companies have seen their market   caps balloon recently, and here's what they boil down to.Cloud companies have tremendous advantages over companies that   make physical things or provide high-touch services. When   software is packaged as a service (SaaS), it can be rolled out to   customers incredibly quickly. It can require minimal direction   interaction with users. Early on in the life of a SaaS company,   sales growth rates of 70%, 80%, even up to 100% are not unheard   of.The cloud-based commerce platform   Shopify    , for example, has a five-year average annual sales growth rate   of 95%. Shopify provides a suite of products that helps primarily   small-to-medium businesses connect potential customers to their   merchandise online and through social media.           Cloud-company stocks are beating the rest of tech. Image     Source: Getty Images.While we've witnessed these growth rates before -- like during   the early 2000s for Salesforce -- what we're seeing for the first   time is how sustainable some unusually high growth rates can be   in the cloud. Salesforce today is a 19-year-old company. Yet its   average annual sales growth rate over the last five years has   been 30%. If that were to persist, sales would double in roughly   2.5 years.           A $10 billion company like Salesforce doubling sales in less than   a few years is hard to wrap your head around. But Salesforce --   even at its size -- is all about speed.It has a lock on big clients because it makes their sales   teams more effective while minimizing IT   upgrades. Salesforce's cloud creates a seamless connection   between salespeople and key corporate decision-makers. Its   products can better anticipate needs though a data-driven   feedback loop and introduce customers to new products as their   businesses change. This short cycle is unique to the cloud, it   compounds over time, and it's a key reason the market's willing   to pay up for shares.Cloud businesses are capable of ramping up new users in a   hurry. And they're increasingly finding ways to ingrain these   users with their products. The type of user will depend on the   cloud business: Salesforce tends to serve businesses, whereas a   cloud business like   Intuit    's serves individuals.Users of all sizes can be more quickly integrated into an   ecosystem in recent years due to the rise of one key tool:   application programming interfacing, or ""APIs."" If it   sounds complex, it's not. What APIs do is facilitate   communication between data sources and software.           When software can rapidly be integrated, customers get more   functionality. It also allows the cloud business to collect more   data on, say, your financial habits. As a result, two effects   occur: the more users, the better the data; and the more   integration, the more embedded the users become. These things   build on one another rapidly. This is how cloud companies build   what investors call an ""   economic moat    "" at a pace we've never seen before.           In this case, the economic moat consists of high switching costs   and data-driven network effects. Again, investors look at a cloud   business and see how fast it's growing and that its business is   becoming more durable by the day. Paying 10 times sales doesn't   seem   that    ridiculous.Building on the above, growth of a single and highly   functional product is not sufficient in this market. Cloud   companies are adding products in rapid-fire fashion -- building   an ecosystem of products in a handful of years, a process that   used to take decades.           Apple's ecosystem took years to create. The iPod came out in   2001, the iPhone debuted six years later, and then the iPad took   another three years. Building an ecosystem of physical products   takes time. Of course, Apple is also a software company, so it   was hooking users into its universe in that way, too.           Cloud companies have proved that they can both acquire and build   products rapidly. And they can take a user from uninitiated to   ingrained rapidly, too. Think of a new Intuit customer going from   Mint to QuickBooks Online to TurboTax (all Intuit products) in   the course of a single tax season.           Salesforce can perform the same feat at an enterprise level, so   its suite of $1-billion-plus clouds has now grown to four:           Image source: Salesforce 10-K.       Investors see the creation of an ecosystem and think of the   success that companies like Alphabet and Apple have had with   theirs. That's a long-term trend that makes the market salivate,   only now it occurs at an even faster pace.This is a unique time for companies running cloud-only   businesses. The first reason they're soaring is their growth   rates -- primarily in new users and sales. Earnings, in fact, are   usually scarce early on in a cloud business's existence.           But their success will depend on the No. 2 and No. 3 reasons   listed above. Whether long-term investors should be willing to   pay up for a given cloud business should come down to signs of an   emerging economic moat. High switching costs and network effects   could be worth a premium. Those companies without them could fall   as quickly as they rise.          10 stocks we like better than Salesforce.com            When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

2018-05-23,"After U.S. Dodd-Frank law changes, lobbyists fight for more","By Michelle Price and Pete SchroederWASHINGTON, May 23 (Reuters) - Buoyed by the U.S. Congress passing legislation on Tuesday easing rules on banks, some business groups hope lawmakers will move quickly to change other financial rules they say are hurting Main Street businesses.But with Democrats still smarting from the battle over the rewrite of the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reform law and mid-term elections on the horizon in November, getting another de-regulation package across the line will be tough, said lobbyists and Congressional sources.On Tuesday, the U.S. House of Representatives passed an earlier Senate bill reforming the Dodd-Frank rules after the Senate leadership promised to consider additional measures to help start-ups and listed companies.The compromise has raised hopes among business groups that the moderate Senate Democrats who backed Tuesday's legislation may support a securities law package that would include capital markets bills already passed by the House.The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the Nasdaq stock exchange operator, and the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association, say changes are urgently needed to counter a 50 percent decline in the number of listed firms over the past two decades.Testifying before the House on Wednesday, they pushed a raft of measures to lighten the reporting, disclosure and corporate governance requirements for small companies.They have also advocated rule-easing that could chip away at the Chinese wall designed to prevent analysts from writing favorable research about companies in order to help investment banker colleagues win business.Speaking to Reuters on Wednesday, spokespeople for the Chamber of Commerce and Nasdaq said they believed Democrats may support changes because securities markets reforms have historically been a bipartisan issue.""We don't see this as controversial, we think these are fairly technical and incremental changes,"" said Nasdaq general counsel Ed Knight, adding he was hopeful of a deal this year although it was unclear what legislative path it would take.But the intense fight over the Dodd-Frank law reform, which saw some senators including Elizabeth Warren publicly attack their fellow Democrats, may deter moderate Democrats from revisiting financial rules before the midterm elections, sources said.At least eight Democrats would need to join with Republicans for the Senate to pass another package.Senator Heidi Heitkamp, a Democratic sponsor of the Dodd-Frank rewrite, told Reuters on Tuesday she had not committed to support further rule-easing but that there may be some provisions she would be willing to advance.Senator Joe Donnelly, another Democratic sponsor, is open to considering additional bills, according to his spokesperson.Lobbyists for capital markets reforms are also racing against time, with the Senate calendar already full of hearings that could crowd out debate on a securities bill before re-election campaigning begins in the fall.If lawmakers fail to consider a standalone package, Ellis Rochkind said there could be opportunities for lawmakers to include the House's capital markets bills in other must-pass legislation, such as those on Flood Insurance or appropriations.""The bills are incremental but when looked at together make meaningful changes,"" she added."

2016-10-31,ICE Pre-Earnings: Data Services To Continue Boosting Top-Line,"The impressive growth in oil and metal derivatives volumes has been offset by the decline in equity options and cash equity trading volumes. As investors seek safe investment alternatives, a gap in supply and demand  has led to increased volatility in the oil and metal market, thereby propelling the trading volumes. Energy derivatives have seen around 3% year-over-year and 10% year-to-date growth. Metals derivatives have grown by 2% year over year and over 17% year to date. These volumes are likely to continue growing in the coming quarters, thereby generating the transaction-based revenues.       The company's cash equity activity has gone down for the first time in the year, possibly due to lack of investors' interest in the wake of uncertain financial conditions. However, with the possibility of improvement in these conditions, the trading volumes are likely to improve in the coming quarters.

NDAQ  reported first-quarter 2017 adjusted earnings per share of $1.10 per share, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 5 cents. Also, the bottom line improved 19% year over year.   Higher revenues as well as growth across all segments supported the upside. However, the improvement was limited by an increase in expenses.         Nasdaq, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise         Nasdaq, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS   Surprise    |      Nasdaq, Inc. Quote   Segment wise, net revenue at Market Services  jumped 8.5% from the year-ago quarter to $218 million. The upside was driven by higher revenues from the ISE and Nasdaq CXC acquisitions.     Revenues at Corporate Services  climbed 11.9% year over year to $160 million. This was mainly due to the inclusion of revenues from the Marketwired and Boardvantage acquisitions in the Corporate Solutions business.     Information Services  revenues rose 3.8% year over year to $138 million. Higher proprietary data products revenues and the inclusion of revenues from the acquisitions of ISE and Nasdaq CXC led to the increase in data products revenues.

Dividend and Share Repurchase Update      The board of directors approved a 19% increase in quarterly dividend to 38 cents per share.

2018-04-27,Key Takeaways From CME's Q1,"We have a $146 price estimate for CME's stock  , which is below the current market price. We have created an    interactive dashboard   where you can change the company's forecast revenue, margins, and other key drivers to gauge how they would impact its expected results and valuation.    Despite the recent declines, the company remains bullish on its Market Data and Information Services segment, with new products in the pipeline with enhanced business intelligence and machine learning capabilities. The company has managed to gain traction by offering data services to its customers largely free of charge until recently, and we expect that many of its existing customers will be willing to pay for more advanced products.           Recent rate hikes and the Fed's indications of a series of hikes in the year ahead has boosted investor interest in interest rate derivatives, with trading volumes 29% ahead of the levels seen in Q1 2017. Energy derivatives maintained solid volumes with the recent surge in  oil prices  and OPEC's recent stance on capping production. Meanwhile, metal derivatives saw a 39% growth in trading volumes as they are considered a safe investment asset. Moreover, the continuous movements in gold and  silver prices  have continued to boost metals derivative volumes. We expect further volume growth with further improvement in the U.S. economy.    CME also recently launched bitcoin futures trading on its platform. With this initiative, the company is looking to get an early mover's advantage in the volatile but fast-growing space. Out of a total limit of 21 million bitcoins which can be mined, based on the existing protocol, the current bitcoins in circulation stands around 17 million. With the growth in supply slowing down, bitcoin trading provides a solid opportunity for exchanges. Over the long run, this could provide a healthy boost to CME's trading volumes.What's behind Trefis?

2018-01-05,ICE's Q4 Results Likely To Be Affected By Dip In Derivative Trading,"Due to the rate hike in June 2016, and the expectations of further rate increases by the end of 2016 (which did occur), IntercontinentalExchange's interest rate derivative volumes registered a sharp increase in Q4 2016. Consequently, Q4 2017 saw a decline in financial derivatives volumes due to the difficult year-on-year comparison.  However, we expect further growth in trading volumes with the Fed's expectation of further hikes in the year ahead. Meanwhile, we expect that metals - despite having shown a slight decline - will likely remain in demand as a safe investment asset, leading to fairly steady volumes.We have a $70 price estimate for ICE's stock  , which is about in line with the current market price.

2017-02-07,Intercontinental Exchange Inc's Earnings Continue Climbing Higher,"Intercontinental Exchange    (NYSE: ICE) , or ICE, continued its momentum during the fourth   quarter, as revenue and earnings both rose sharply. Driving that   growth was last year's acquisition of Interactive Data, which   helped to more than double ICE's data services revenue.   Meanwhile, the company continues to push out costs, which is   driving earnings growth. With additional merger synergies on the   way, the company sees its growth continuing in 2017.             Metric                        Q4 2016                        Q4 2015                        Year-Over-Year Change           Revenues, less transaction-based expenses$1.1 billion$875 million30.1%Adjusted net income$428 million$369 million16%Adjusted EPS$0.71$0.659.2%Data source: Intercontinental Exchange.Acquisition synergies pushed earnings higher:           Image source: Getty Images.CEO Jeffrey Sprecher commented on the company's fourth quarter   and full-year results by stating that:Amidst a volatile and dynamic environment, we delivered our     eleventh consecutive year of record revenue. Despite the     challenges of market volatility driven by geopolitics, we     achieved our objectives by working closely with our customers     across trading, risk management and data to again deliver     strong revenue growth, margin expansion and double-digit profit     increases. We are excited about collaborating with our     customers in 2017 given the range of ways we are working to     serve their evolving trading, listing, data and risk management     needs.ICE capped a good year, continuing its trend of growing   revenue, margins, and earnings. Of particular note was its   ability to integrate Interactive Data faster than expected, which   drove out costs. Overall, the company delivered $160 million of   expense synergies last year and anticipates capturing another $60   million this year and $25 million to $30 million in 2018 and   2019.The ability to quickly push costs out of newly acquired   businesses is an important driver of profit growth for exchanges.   Rival   Nasdaq    (NASDAQ: NDAQ) , for example, noted last quarter that it had   already achieved $38 million of annualized run-rate cost   synergies for acquisitions completed last year out of its $60   million target. Nasdaq's focus this year will be to successfully   integrate those acquisitions to ""ensure their full potential is   delivered to our clients and shareholders."" The quicker Nasdaq   and ICE can reach their goals, the more it will improve   earnings.ICE hopes to deliver $60 million of merger synergies this   year, which along with other cost-cutting moves would push its   operating expenses down to a range of $2.23 billion to $2.27   billion. At the midpoint, that is a decrease of 2.2% from last   year. In addition, the company sees its data service revenue   rising 5% this year, while its share count should decline due to   the stock buyback. These factors should combine to push its   financial results higher in 2017.          10 stocks we like better than Intercontinental     Exchange            When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

2017-04-01,The Biggest Risk Facing Frontier Communications,"Frontier    (NASDAQ: FTR) has struggled mightily in its attempts to become a   bigger player in the cable and internet space. But even as it has   bled some of the subscribers it paid   Verizon    (NYSE: VZ) $10.54 billion for, it has had one major thing going   for it -- its dividend.Now, as the company considers a reverse split to keep its   stock above   NASDAQ    's $1 per share threshold, the value of that dividend, and   whether it will continue to exist at all has become highly   questionable. Frontier has already   declared    it will pay a dividend of $0.105 per common share in Q1 payable   on March 31 to people who owned shares at the close of business   on March 15. That's good short-term news for embattled investors,   and in-line with what it has paid for the past two years, but the   long-term prospects look bleak.                    Image source:   YCharts    .The company has seen its stock price steadily fall as it has   struggled to hold onto the 3.3 million voice connections, 2.1   million broadband customers, and 1.2 million FiOS video   subscribers in California, Texas, and Florida (CTF) it purchased   from Verizon. Frontier's losses in Q2, the first quarter after   the deal closed, were expected, but the drop in Q3 was harder to   explain. When the company lost another 144,000 residential   subscribers and 14,000 more business customers in Q4, questions   as to whether the company could turn things around became   legitimate.As you can see on the chart above, the company's stock price   has been falling fairly steadily all year. Frontier's failure to   at least stabilize its subscriber loss in Q4, after suggesting it   would happen during the Q2 and Q3 earnings calls, sent its stock   price plummeting, something the company likely expected as it   floated the idea of a reverse split in its   Q4 earnings release    :Frontier also announced that its Board of Directors has     approved and will place before Frontier's stockholders at the     May 2017 Annual Meeting a charter amendment for a reverse stock     split of Frontier Communications common stock. The charter     amendment will provide for a reverse stock split ratio between     1-for-10 and 1-for-25, with the Board designating the final     ratio within 90 days after the charter amendment is approved by     stockholders.It's easy to see why Frontier pays a dividend. The payments   keep shareholders on board while the company tries to transform   itself. The problem is that Frontier lost $80 million in Q4 and   $373 million for the year, before paying the dividend. After the   payments are factored in the full-year loss jumps to $587   million.           Frontier has been losing video subscribers. Image source:     Getty Images.The company, it's important to note, has not suggested it will   eliminate its dividend. In fact, CEO Daniel McCarthy implied that   Frontier planned to keep it during the Q4 earnings call, which   was transcribed by   Seeking Alpha    (registration required), saying that the board had considered the   issue two weeks before the call.""They obviously look at the allocation of capital and   resources for us,"" he said. ""They reviewed the complete plan that   we presented on 2017, as well as the cash flows and all the   initiatives that we're undertaking right now and they were   comfortable declaring the dividend. So there has been no change   in our policy on that perspective and they will just continue to   evaluate that going forward.""The problem is that continuing to borrow money in order to   fund a dividend has its obvious drawbacks. In the long-term it's   not sustainable, but if the company eliminates the dividend after   its reverse split, it runs the risk of seeing its newly   propped-up stock sink further. That leaves it with three   options:Frontier has said it plans to go forward as it has, but has   left itself wiggle room to make a change. McCarthy's statement   was qualified by the words ""right now"" and it's very likely that   if results -- specifically subscriber counts -- do not turn   around in Q1, then the dividend will be very much in jeopardy.   Were that to happen, it would make an already struggling stock   even less attractive, and perhaps force the company to consider a   sale or pursue other strategic options.          10 stocks we like better than Frontier     Communications            When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

2018-04-26,Nasdaq Benefits From Reinvigorated Trading Volume,"In its   last sequential quarter    ,   Nasdaq Inc.    (NASDAQ: NDAQ)  relied on non-trading segments for growth as   its market-services segment turned in a near flat performance. In   the first quarter of 2018, however, healthy trading volumes   resumed, and Nasdaq achieved expansion in each of its four   operating segments. Before sifting through important highlights   for the quarter, let's briefly review the top-level   performance:     Data source: Nasdaq Inc.Nasdaq's impressive double-digit revenue gain was composed       of 9.4% organic growth, a 3% boost from favorable       foreign-currency translation and a positive impact of 2.2%       from acquisitions.The company's       operating margin        slipped 140 basis points, to roughly 41%, against the       comparable prior-year quarter. Management attributed the cost       creep to higher operating expenses due to recent acquisitions       and higher incentive-compensation expense tied to the       company's top-line gains during the quarter.After posting a revenue increase of just $3 million in the       last sequential quarter, the market-services segment recorded       an improvement of $32 million, to $250 million, in the first       quarter of 2018. The 14.7% increase was propelled by higher       trading volumes in equity derivatives and cash equities.According to management, market-services' results, which       represented a quarterly revenue record, were made possible,       in part, by the successful integration of International       Securities Exchange (ISE), the U.S. options exchange that       Nasdaq acquired nearly two years ago.Corporate services boosted revenue by $12 million, to $172       million, and information services reported a $36 million rise       in revenue, to $174 million. Together, these two segments       comprise just over half of Nasdaq's total revenue.Management attributed information services' appreciable       top-line leap to the October 2017 acquisition of       institutional data-analytics provider eVestment, strong       organic growth, and momentum in the segment's indexing and       licensing services.Market technology, Nasdaq's smallest division, improved       revenue by 7.6%, to $70 million. Market technology's order       backlog, an indicator of its fiscal health, increased 4% year       over year, to $735 million at quarter-end.In mid-April, Nasdaq announced the completion of the sale       of its digital media services and public relations solutions       businesses to privately held       West Corporation         for approximately $335 million. Management had       recently deemed these businesses to be non-core revenue       streams, given the company's evolving strategic focus on       areas such as product listing, data analytics, and       client-centered technologies.Total assets under management (AUM) in exchange-traded       products (ETPs) linked to Nasdaq's proprietary index family       grew 25% year over year, reaching a record $173 billion at       the end of the first quarter.                                            Image source: Getty Images.In Nasdaq's earnings press release, CEO Adena Friedman   assessed the organization's progress against its operational and   strategic goals:I am [also] encouraged by the early progress against our     2018 execution priorities. This includes advancing our     strategic pivot as an analytics and technology partner,     including the recently completed sale of the Public Relations     Solutions and Digital Media Services businesses, which allows     us to focus our Corporate Services business on the most     strategic services and solutions to our corporate clients.In addition, we continue to expand our pipeline of     opportunities in our 'markets economy' technology strategy, and     build momentum around our competitive position across several     core businesses. While industry macro conditions have been     developing positively, we remain focused on structurally     advancing our capabilities to deliver over the long term for     clients and shareholders, across a broad range of environmental     backdrops.Nasdaq revised its non-   GAAP     operating expense for the year to account for the   transaction with West Corporation. For full-year 2018, the   organization now expects non-GAAP operating expense to land   between $1.295 million and $1.335 million from a prior band of   $1.375 billion to $1.415 billion.Of course, alongside the expense decline, Nasdaq will lose the   revenue associated with its digital media and PR subsidiaries. At   the next reporting period, investors will get a sense of the   bottom-line effect of the dispositions as the company records its   first quarter following the sale of these two small business   lines. If Nasdaq continues to stretch its top line at a   double-digit pace, the impact is likely to be minimal.          10 stocks we like better than Nasdaq            When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

2016-12-08,Massive Growth In Trading Volumes Across Most Product Line For CME In November,"The likelihood of an interest rate hike by the Fed in early 2017 has possibly led to a significant growth in its derivative volumes in November. Metals, being a safe investment asset, have continued to grow at a phenomenal pace for over a year, amid subdued macroeconomic conditions. The continuous fluctuation in  oil prices  due to its demand-supply gap, has kept the trading volumes at an all-time high. Equities and Foreign exchange derivative volumes have also risen, after dismal performance in the previous quarter    With the expectations of markets to remain volatile in the near term, we expect the trading volumes to continue growing.See    the full Trefis analysis for CME Group.

2018-01-17,Cboe Global Markets vs. Nasdaq: Which Is the Safer Bet?,"The year 2017 was swamped with a series of events, ranging from rising interest rates to a historical tax reform. Also, rapidly-changing climatic conditions made a substantial impact across the finance sector. But this New Year 2018 buoys fresh hopes, instilling confidence among investors.   Also, the economic growth is gaining traction. Optimistic employment outlook and improving GDP bear testimony for the same.     The Securities and Exchanges industry is of late, characterized by improving trading volumes. This in turn will help improve the clearing and transaction fees. The players in the industry have been witnessing expansion in their average daily volumes.     The Securities and Exchanges industry is mainly dependent on its product and service portfolios to churn out revenues. The major services include trade execution, clearing, settlement services for securities and commodity contracts, listing services as well as trading and clearing systems services. With introduction of new products, which not only cater to the derivatives industry's demand but also complement the core product lines, the market position and global reach of the key players are anticipated to become stronger.     Interestingly, the Securities and Exchanges industry has been riding on the wave of bitcoin futures that have created a ripple across the finance sector. With the growing popularity of these bitcoin futures, the individual exchanges are launching the same, as more and more investors are expressing their interest in buying the cryptocurrency. On Dec 18, 2017, CME Group Inc. CME  self-certified the initial listing of its Bitcoin futures contract. Although bitcoin has massive growth prospects, investors also need to be careful about investing in the same.     With the global economy raising enough optimism, the Securities and Exchanges industry is sure to benefit from the abovementioned positives. Moreover, a thriving economy is likely to provide enough opportunities to this industry to focus on building a strategic economic market model through technological advances and upgrade of diverse service as well as product offerings. This, in turn, will help the industry stay ahead and maintain a competitive streak amid the volatile industry dynamics.     The Securities and Exchanges industry is ranked at #6 (in the top 2% of the Zacks Industry Rank  for 265+ industries), outperforming the S&P 500 index in a year with a surge of 33.3%. While the elite index has climbed 23.0%.     Here we focus on two major players from the Securities and Exchanges industry: Nasdaq, Inc.  NDAQ  provides trading, clearing, exchange technology, regulatory, securities listing, information and public company services worldwide while Cboe Global Markets, Inc.  CBOE  operates as an options exchange in the United States. While Nasdaq has a market capitalization of $13.4 billion, Cboe Global Markets has $14.8 billion of the same.     It will be interesting to note which stock is better positioned in terms of fundamentals.     Two bullish ranked stocks from the same industry are CME Group and Intercontinental Exchange, Inc. ICE  , holding a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see    the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy)   stocks here   .    Zacks Rank      Cboe Global Markets sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) with a slight edge over Nasdaq, holding a Zacks Rank of 2.     Price Performance      While Nasdaq has underperformed the industry  in a year's time, Cboe Global Markets has significantly outperformed the same during the same time period. Shares of Nasdaq have rallied 19.5% in a year's time, while the Cboe Global Markets stock has soared 73.7% in the same time frame. Here, Cboe Global Markets emerges as a clear winner.     VGM Score      Cboe Global Markets carries an unimpressive VGM Score  of F, whereas Nasdaq has a VGM Score of D. Here, V stands for Value, G for Growth and M for Momentum and the score is a weighted combination of these three scores. So, in this case, Nasdaq has an edge over Cboe Global Markets.     Valuation      The price to book value metric is the best multiple used for valuing securities exchanges. Compared with industry's P/B ratio of 2.98, Nasdaq is underpriced with a reading of 2.33, while Cboe Global Markets is overpriced with a reading of 5.16. Thus, this round evidently goes to Nasdaq as the company's shares are cheaper in comparison to Cboe Global Markets.       Debt-to-Equity      Both Nasdaq and Cboe Global Markets have higher debt-to-equity ratio compared with the industry average of 24.53. Here, Cboe Global Markets with a leverage ratio of 45.60 has an edge over Nasdaq that records the metric at of 62.58. This round then goes to Cboe Global Markets.       Return on Equity      Both the companies have outperformed the industry in a year's time. While Cboe Global Markets' return on equity of 14.70% has outperformed the industry average of 9.92%, Nasdaq's stood at 12.69%. Thus, Cboe Global Markets wins this round again.       Dividend Yield      Cboe Global Markets' dividend yield is 0.83% while Nasdaq's is 1.89%. In this case, Nasdaq's dividend yield clearly outshines the industry's average of 1.36%. Nasdaq is a runaway success in this round.       Earnings Estimate Revisions and Growth Projections      The Nasdaq stock has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 earnings being moved 5.8% north to $4.77 per share in the last 60 days, while the consensus mark for Cboe Global Market's 2018 bottom line has been revised 12.5% upward to $4.49 in the same time span.     For Nasdaq, the consensus estimate for 2018 earnings per share reflects a year-over-year rally of 14.11%. The stock has long-term expected EPS growth of 9.70%.     For Cboe Global Markets, the metric for the current year represents a year-over-year surge of 30.95%. The stock has long-term expected earnings per share growth of 19.70%.     This round goes to Cboe Global Markets.     Earnings Surprise History      Per the companies' surprise history, Cboe Global Markets surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the last four quarters with an average beat of 5.50%. Nasdaq also delivered positive surprises in the trailing four quarters with a four-quarter average beat of 4.00%.     Nasdaq has an Earnings ESP  of 0.08%, whereas Cboe Global Markets has 0.57%. Therefore, per our proven model, both these players are anticipated to beat on earnings based on a bullish rank as well as positive ESP.     Here, Cboe Global Markets once more edges past Nasdaq.     To Conclude      Cboe Global Markets is a better pick than Nasdaq on the back of a bullish Zacks Rank, favorable price performance, strong leverage and return on equity ratios, a robust dividend yield, upward earnings estimate revisions and growth projections plus a solid earnings surprise history. Thus, based on our comparative analysis, Cboe Global Markets has a visible advantage over Nasdaq.   More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!

2018-04-23,Nasdaq proposes letting companies decide where their shares trade,"By John McCrankApril 23 (Reuters) - Nasdaq Inc  on Monday said it will ask regulators to let it give thinly-traded companies that list on its main U.S. stock exchange a choice as to whether their shares can be traded on other exchanges, with the aim of making it easier for investors to buy the stocks.There are 13 U.S. stock exchanges and currently, regardless of where a company is listed, its shares trade on all of them, as well as around 40 private broker-run trading venues. Critics say this fragments trading activity, making it more difficult for buyers and sellers to find each other.""Our markets are no longer able to support small growth companies,"" said Frank Hatheway, Nasdaq's chief economist, referring to the U.S. markets overall. He was taking part in a roundtable discussion hosted by the SEC in Washington on the topic of improving the markets for thinly-traded companies.Under the Nasdaq plan, trading on private venues, such as dark pools, would be allowed to continue as usual.Rival exchange operator Cboe Global Markets  balked at the idea of exchanges being allowed to have monopolies on the trading of certain stocks, saying it would carry the risk that exchanges would begin charging higher fees for things like market data and exchange connectivity.""The exclusive listing concept is interesting but it is a bit of a blunt instrument,"" Cboe President Chris Concannon told the roundtable, made up of industry experts and academics.Of the 13 U.S. stock exchanges, 11 are owned by either Intercontinental Exchange Inc'sNYSE unit, Nasdaq, or Cboe. Another is in the process of being bought by NYSE. IEX Group, which runs only one exchange, recommended to the panel giving thinly-traded companies the option of having their stocks trade on one exchange per exchange group, which would mean a stock would trade on four exchanges instead of 13.In October, the U.S. Treasury Department recommended that the SEC allow companies to decide how many stock exchanges their shares trade as part of a broader regulatory review.The SEC is seeking public comment on the issue."

2016-12-12,Cintas (CTAS) to Be Added to Nasdaq 100: Should You Buy?,"As part of its annual routine, benchmark index Nasdaq, Inc. NDAQ  recently re-ranked the NASDAQ-100 index in accordance with the quadruple witch expiration of the quarter. The reshuffled index will include four new companies replacing an identical number of companies from the previous list and will be effective from Dec 19, 2016.          Cintas started fiscal 2017 on a positive note, recording solid first-quarter results on the back of healthy top-line growth. Both earnings and revenues improved year over year and beat the respective Zacks Consensus Estimate.     While quarterly revenues increased 7.9% to $1,294.1 million, organic growth improved 5.7% year over year. The superior top-line performance was primarily attributable to the addition of new customers, strong customer retention and higher penetration of existing customers through better and innovative products and services.     Cintas aims to continually achieve revenue build up by increasing penetration levels at existing customers and broadening the customer base to include fresh business segments. The company also identifies additional product and service opportunities for its current and future customers to expand its portfolio. This focused approach for steady top-line growth is commendable.     Cintas has inked a definitive agreement to acquire rival G&K Services Inc. GK  to fuel its growth momentum. The combined company is likely to cater to over one billion business customers with an extended product portfolio and additional processing capacity. Customer service is also likely to improve with increased route density. The synergies from the combined operations are likely to yield $130 million to $140 million in cost savings and the transaction is anticipated to be accretive to Cintas' earnings from the second year of its operation.     Buoyed by the healthy first-quarter fiscal 2017 results, Cintas also increased its guidance for fiscal 2017. The company expects revenues in the range of $5.160 billion to $5.225 billion, up 5.2-6.5% year over year. Earnings from continuing operations are expected to be within $4.55-$4.63 per share, up from $4.35-$4.45 anticipated earlier. The current earnings per share guidance represent a year-over-year improvement of 11.2-13.2%. The bullish guidance looks quite enterprising for the investors. In addition, healthy organic growth over the past few quarters has lent stability to the revenues and has enabled the company to comfortably beat the earnings estimates for a positive earnings surprise of 5.5% over the trailing four quarters.     We remain encouraged by the inherent growth potential of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock. A better-ranked stock in the industry is Superior Uniform Group, Inc. SGC  , carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

2017-02-02,NASDAQ Earnings: Top-line Growth Propelled By Recovery In Trading Volumes And Increased Adoptions of Technology Products,"Surge In Trading Volumes Was Supported By Increased   Volatility And IEX Acquisition The market services segment, which contributed around 37% of Nasdaq's overall revenues in the fourth quarter, grew around 4% in the first nine months of 2016. The trading volumes recovered in the last quarter and this boosted the segment's revenues from the segment. The acquisition of ISE secured NASDAQ, the leading position in equity options trading. With around 40% market share in the U.S., the revenue from this asset class went up by 42% year over year.       Cash equity and fixed income trading commissions, which declined in the first three quarters of the year in comparison to the prior year, remained flat in the fourth quarter. This can be partially attributed to the acquisition of Nasdaq CXC.  Increased trading in the wake of the election and improved economic conditions in the U.S. have propelled the growth in trading commissions for the exchange.       With the continued volatility in the near term, we expect the growth momentum to spill into the year ahead.   Non-Trading Businesses Continued Growth Due To   Acquisitions And Proprietary Products Nasdaq's non-trading business lines, including information, technology and listing services, generate around 40% of the overall revenues. These businesses, which grew over 10% in the first nine months of 2016, grew by over 12% in the fourth quarter. The growth in Information services segment was supported by increased adoption of its in-house products such as IR Insights and Influencer and revenues from the acquisition of ISE. Nasdaq has continued to be favored for listing new companies. Over 73% of the U.S. IPOs in 2016, were listed on Nasdaq. This along with the company's acquisitions drove the 18% growth in Corporate services revenue.              Increased demand for data and technology-related products and services is likely to sustain the growth momentum for these segments. The company indicates around 5% growth in these businesses for the year ahead.Please refer to    the full Trefis analysis for Nasdaq  View Interactive Institutional Research (Powered by Trefis):       Global Large Cap   | U.S. Mid & Small Cap  |    European Large & Mid Cap The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."

2017-07-11,Bridging The Gap: Chinese Investors And U.S. Stocks,"While opportunities are not usually bound by borders, a lack of appropriate mechanisms can hinder success. Such obstructions typically don't undermine the interests of investors to invest outside their homeland. For example, the phenomenal success of Alibaba (BABA)—where a China-based company went on to become the largest IPO ever on a U.S. exchange—is reflective of the overwhelming U.S. investor interest in a Chinese firm.Meanwhile, investing abroad has long been out of reach of most Chinese, but their growing interest in U.S. companies has been noted. Here’s a look at how Nasdaq (NDAQ) and Futu Securities are bridging the gap between U.S. companies and retail investors in the mainland.Nasdaq & FutuWith a vision to provide a seamless platform for Chinese investors to gain access to and invest in U.S. stock markets, Futu Securities was founded in 2012. Futu breaks the image of a conventional brokerage firm, as its services are entirely web-based (desktop and mobile). With over 3 million app users and 100,000 trading accounts as of December 2016, Futu has grown by 500% each year since its launch to become the largest China-based online brokerage firm.While catering to a growing number of Chinese investors, Futu was struggling with cumbersome processes at individual exchange level to gather U.S. market data. To streamline such complexities, Futu struck a partnership with Nasdaq for all its needs related to U.S. exchange equities. Nasdaq provides accurate feeds for all U.S. exchanges via Nasdaq Basic and Global Index Data Services (GIDS) to Futu’s client base.Nasdaq Basic is an exchange-provided alternative for real-time Best Bid and Offer, and Last Sale information for all U.S. exchange stocks. Nasdaq Basic is twice as accurate as compared to any other Level 1 U.S. market data alternatives while being cost effective and easy to manage.Nasdaq’s GIDS provides intraday index values, index component data and end-of-day summary reports for Nasdaq-licensed indexes and some third-party indexes. This translates to reduction in network, administrative and data center costs as multiple data channels are replaced by one data feed.By leveraging Nasdaq Basic and GIDS suites, Futu is connecting China’s small-time investors with U.S. markets in a smart way.Why are Chinese investors interested U.S. Stocks?The trend and enthusiasm to invest in U.S. stocks is driven by multiple factors:Final WordWith days of language barriers, restricted approach and quagmire of rules long forgotten, modern-day Chinese investors are not just more indulging and aware but are embracing advanced technology driven platforms and geographical diversification to explore products that have traditionally remained almost impenetrable.

The Philadelphia Housing Sector Index also was slightly more than 0.2% higher.Among financial stocks moving on news:+ Newmark Group ( NMRK  ) rose Wednesday, at one point climbing over 3%, after the real estate services disclosed the $175 million issue of exchangable preferred limited partnership units to The Royal Bank of Canada (RY,RY.TO) earlier this week in a deal monetizing Nasdaq ( NDAQ  ) shares it regularly receives following the June 2013 sale of its former eSpeed business to the stock market operator. Newmark said it expects to receive around $153 million in net proceeds from the June 18 transaction and plans to use those funds to repay a portion of its $400 million converted term loan, leaving about $247 million still outstanding on the loan maturing in September 2019. Newmark also will be able to draw up to $153 million from its revolving credit facility following the upcoming loan repayment.

The deal is expected to close during the first three months of 2019.- QTS Realty Trust ( QTS  ) was retreating Wednesday, dropping almost 1% in recent trading, after the real estate investment trust began a $225 million public offering of 2.25 million shares of its Series B cumulative convertible perpetual preferred stock at $100.00 apiece. The company also plan to issue a 30-day option to the underwriters to buy up to 337,500 additional shares of the preferred stock to cover over-allotments.

2017-05-16,Solid Trading Volumes and Acquired Revenue Bolster CBOE Holdings,"Exchange operator   CBOE Holdings    (NASDAQ: CBOE)  enjoyed healthy trading volumes during the   first quarter of 2017, as its earnings report, released on May   11, revealed. Additionally, the completion of CBOE's $4.0 billion   acquisition of Bats Global Markets on Feb. 28 provided a material   lift to revenue, while broadening the scope of CBOE's markets and   trading services.Data source: CBOE Holdings, Inc.Organic net revenue rose $11.1 million to $154.2 million,       an eight percent increase, driven primarily by higher net       revenue from the company's       VIX        (Volatility Index) futures products and       SPX         (S&P 500 Index) options products.The closing of the Bats transaction on the last day of       February added $39.2 million in revenue to CBOE's books in       the month of March alone, accounting for 27 percentage points       of the company's 35% revenue increase during the quarter.Despite higher revenue, net income and diluted earnings       per share both fell, as seen in the table above. Higher       expenses resulted from $65.2 million in acquisition-related       expenses, $14.4 million in       amortization of intangible assets         that CBOE acquired in the transaction, and $9.1       million in accelerated stock compensation.Previously, CBOE reported under a single operating       segment. But following the completion of the Bats merger, the       combined company now reports under five distinct segments:       options, U.S. equities, futures, European equities, and       global FX (foreign exchange). Information on segment       results which follows was presented by the company on a pro       forma basis in its earnings filing.Options net revenue of $135.1 million improved 2% from the       prior year, largely on increased transaction fee income, as       well as higher trading volume in SPX options.U.S. equities revenue of $72.7 million was virtually       unchanged from Q1 2016, as non-transactional revenue offset a       decline in transaction-based revenue.Futures revenue soared by 37% to $28.8 million. Average       daily volume (ADV) of VIX contracts jumped 18%, while revenue       per contract, or RPC, rose by 10%. The $7.8 million increase       recorded by the futures segment provided the bulk of CBOE's       $11.1 million organic revenue improvement during the quarter.       Volatility in equity markets may be declining as of late, yet       the appetite for VIX trading continues to swell.In European equities, a new market for CBOE acquired via       the merger, revenue declined 4% to $17.9 million, primarily       on U.S. dollar strength versus the British pound.Global FX, the combined company's smallest segment, booked       a revenue increase of 4%, to $10.8 million, which stemmed       from non-transactional fees implemented in 2016.                    Image source: Getty Images.CBOE's purchase of former rival Bats took up much of the   discussion in the company's earnings conference call with   analysts. CEO Edward Tilly discussed deal advantages at length.   The following excerpt nicely illustrates what CBOE hopes to   extract from the tie-up:First, it grows our company and allows us to scale up,     enabling us to increase our profit margins and strategic     optionality. The acquisition also increases our recurring     non-transaction revenue and further enhances our strong growth     in margin profile. Second, it significantly [diversifies] our     product line into new asset classes and geographies, creates     new revenue sources, attracts new users to our marketplace, and     enables us to efficiently provide packaged offerings,     particularly for our large customers.Third, it enhances innovation at CBOE by giving us the     opportunity to shape and capture revenue from every aspect of     the product development trading cycle. With the addition of     Bats' Global ETF listing and trading venues, we can now design     new indexes, list them, educate more customers on how to trade     them and generate and package market data to deliver     incremental revenue and create new products... Fourth, the     acquisition grows our customer base and immediately affords us     the opportunity to cross-sell additional products and services     to more customers.While the Bats acquisition clearly provides a revenue lift to   CBOE, it also extends the scale of the company, and makes it a   much more formidable competitor to exchange operator   Nasdaq, Inc.    (NASDAQ: NDAQ) , which itself has recently   undertaken acquisitions to diversify revenue and   expand services    .For now, CBOE must focus on the hard work of integrating Bat's   trading platforms and services. If integration proceeds   smoothly, CBOE projects that it will realize $50 million in   annual cost synergies from the merger in year three (post 2017   closing), and $65 million by year five. Next quarter will be the   first full quarter of combined operations, so shareholders are   already anticipating feedback on the integration in the Q2 2017   report, as well as a clearer window into full-year prospects for   the combined entity.          10 stocks we like better than CBOE Holdings            When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Aflac Incorporated Price, Consensus and EPS   Surprise    |      Aflac Incorporated Quote           Segments Results       Aflac Japan Total revenues declined 10.5% year over year to $3.8 billion (yen 419 billion). Pretax operating earnings decreased 9.6% to $748 million.At its Japan segment, premium income, net of reinsurance agreements, decreased 3.5% year over year to $3.1 billion ( yen 355.3 billion) as savings products reached premium paid-up status in the quarter. Net investment income, net of amortized hedge costs, increased 1.1% to $0.6 million (yen 62.5 billion) due to the foreign currency impact of U.S. dollar-denominated investments.Growth rates in Japan for the third quarter were suppressed as a result of a weaker yen/dollar exchange rate.   Aflac U.S. Total revenues increased 2.1% year over year to $1.6 billion.The company's U.S. segment reported a 2.1% year-over-year increase in premium income to $1.4 billion.

Guidance Updated The company expects earnings per share for 2017 within $6.75 to $6.95 compared with the earlier projected range of $6.40-$6.65.If the yen averages 105-115 to the dollar in the fourth quarter, operating earnings, a non-U.S. GAAP measure, will be within $1.42 to $1.66 per diluted share.The company expects to buy back shares worth $1.3-$1.5 billion in 2017.   Our Take Aflac's third-quarter earnings reflected strength in its U.S operations.

2017-07-26,Nasdaq (NDAQ) 2nd Quarter Profit Surges More Than Twofold,"Shares of Nasdaq (NDAQ) are up slightly in Wednesday’s pre-market session after the exchange operator reported second quarter fiscal 2017 earnings results that beat Wall Street expectations on both the top and bottom lines.Driven by better-than-expected revenue in its market services business that oversees transactions, clearing and settlement services, the New York-based company reported second-quarter profit of $147 million, yielding a net income of 87 cents per share, surging 107% year over year from $70 million, or 42 cents per share earned a year earlier.On an adjusted basis, when taking out one-time gains and costs Nasdaq earned $1.02 per share. Not only was that above consensus estimates of 96 cents per share, it marked a year-over-year increase of 13%. Second quarter revenue rose to $1 billion in the period, while adjusted revenue (excluding transaction-based expenses) came in $602 million, up 8% year over year, also topped Street forecasts.The company attributed the revenue increase from positive impacts from acquisitions and $15 million, or 3%, organic growth. Nasdaq also benefited from strong revenue growth in its market services segment, the company's biggest business, which posted a 16.5% rise in sales, reaching $620 million.Notably, this marks a significant growth acceleration from the first quarter when market services revenue rose 8.5% to $218 million, which offset a $6 million negative impact in foreign exchange rates.“In addition to achieving a new quarterly net revenue record, we are making significant progress against our 2017 execution priorities, by commercializing key technologies with new products available through the Nasdaq Financial Framework and Analytics Hub, achieving our merger synergies ahead of our original timeline, and raising our market share in our largest trading categories significantly above prior year levels,” said CEO Adena Friedman in a statement.Under the leadership of Friedman, Nasdaq has focused on growing its capabilities in information services and market technology businesses. During the quarter, the company posted 7.% increase in information services revenue to $144 million, while market technology revenue grew more modestly by 4.3% to $72 million.The company’s initiatives to grow profit margins, as evidenced by a 7% decline in second quarter operating expenses, fueled the bottom line beat and continues to bear fruit. At the same time, strategic acquisitions, including Canadian stock trading venue CXC and options exchange operator International Securities Exchange — aimed at strengthening the platform — are also paying off. Those acquisitions contributed to some $34 million positive revenue impact during the quarter.The company’s across-the-board solid numbers are further underscored by the winning streak that Nasdaq (the exchange) — home to some of the world's largest tech stocks such as Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), Netflix (NFLX) and Alphabet (GOOGL) — has been on in 2017. And with synergies from recent acquisitions still being realized, Nasdaq has tons of momentum as the second half unfolds.

2017-07-20,Confused About Blockchain? Here's What You Need to Know,"Billionaire and entrepreneur-extraordinaire Mark Cuban   recently   tweeted    that blockchain technology would be ""at the core of most   transactions in the future"". Fellow billionaire Richard Branson   believes blockchain technology could bring about an   economic revolution    .   International Business Machines Corp.    's (NYSE: IBM) vice president of blockchain, Jerry Cuomo,   recently   declared    that 2016 was the year of blockchain experimentation and that   2017 would be the year of adoption.So what's all the fuss about? What makes blockchain technology   so special that it could bring about an economic revolution? Many   investors don't even know what a blockchain is, much less what   makes it worthy of so much attention from the world's largest   corporations and most-revered investors. Some might have a vague   notion that it is what powers cryptocurrencies, like   bitcoins    .It's important for investors to understand the implications of   blockchain technology, how it reaches far beyond the nascent   market of cryptocurrencies and could even disrupt major   industries in the near future. Let's take a closer look at what   it is, why so many are excited about its potential benefits, and   how some companies are already incorporating this technology into   their existing operations.           Image source: Getty Images.A blockchain is a digital, decentralized, and distributed   ledger, having the ability to be easily accessed by many   different parties. This ledger can be used to record virtually   any type of transaction involving different asset classes. After   a transaction is finalized, it is documented on a block. When a   block's memory is full, it is added to the end of the chain in   sequential order. The blockchain becomes a permanent database of   recorded transactions that can never be altered.A node is a computer connected to the network for the purpose   of verifying transactions. As used for   bitcoins    , each node automatically gets a downloaded copy of the   blockchain upon joining the network. Again, just for bitcoins,   the blockchain records information such as the time and amount of   each transaction, but it does not store any personal information   concerning the parties involved. Of course, when used for   applications other than bitcoins, the blockchain can be used to   record all sorts of information.Proponents claim the benefits to blockchain technology are   transactions that are more transparent, secure, streamlined, and   cheaper than other methods. Blockchain technology also allows for   far fewer middlemen to be involved in each transaction, including   payment processors, brokerages, payment networks, and even banks.   Without these parties each taking their own small cut,   transactions are naturally more efficient in time and cost.Last summer,   Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc.    's (NYSE: BR) CEO Rich Daly wrote in        Forbes       about the benefits of blockchain technology.Some people know blockchain as the underlying technology     behind the controversial digital currency Bitcoin. However,     blockchain is so much more; it's incredibly innovative and its     promise is far-reaching. This technology is a secure and     transparent way to digitally track the ownership of assets     before, during, and after transactions, and it has the     potential to ultimately transform everything from how stock     exchanges operate to how proxies are voted.Probably no company is currently doing more with blockchain   technology than IBM. Big Blue recently scored a   deal    with seven major European banks to construct a new trade finance   platform based on blockchain technology. The idea is that the   lowered costs of such a platform will expand access to financing   for smaller businesses that don't have traditional access to   credit.IBM is heavily involved in other applications with the   technology as well. The company recently launched IBM Blockchain,   a cloud-based blockchain-as-a-service of sorts, which will enable   its customers to build blockchain applications in the cloud. In   the company's 2016 letter to shareholders, CEO Ginni Rometty   stated the company was working with over 400 clients on such   projects. For example, IBM is working with   Wal-Mart    to track its food supply chain using blockchain.Of course, IBM is far from alone in this space; several other   companies are currently   using    the technology, too. Earlier this year,   Nasdaq, Inc.    (NASDAQ: NDAQ) , the world's second largest stock exchange, used   blockchain technology to facilitate proxy voting on its Estonian   exchange and is now considering using it for the same purpose   across all of its exchanges. Last September, Broadridge Financial   spent $135 million to acquire assets to develop blockchain   applications for the company's proxy services.   Microsoft Corporation    's (NASDAQ: MSFT) Azure cloud service, supports a   blockchain-as-a-service application similar to IBM's.Blockchain technology could one day disrupt almost the entire   financial industry or it could simply be incorporated into the   sector as another tool in its tool box. Either way, investors   should be aware of the opportunities it might bring to companies   that can successfully integrate it into their operations and the   risks it poses to companies that fail to adapt.          10 stocks we like better than Wal-Mart            When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock     tip, it can pay to listen.

2016-12-15,CME Year 2016 In Review: Impressive Year Despite Industry-wide Decline In Trading Volumes,"Interest Rate Derivatives Continued To Grow Under Fed's   Guidance Interest rate derivatives have been the highest in terms of trading volumes, with around 5% year-to-date growth till Q3. Fed's first interest rate hike in December 2015 post recession, had led to a significant increase in its derivative volumes in Q1. Though the growth in volumes have been low in the subsequent quarter, we expect marked improvement in its volumes in the current quarter, owing to expected rate hike in the near-term.          Oil-price Rally Has Led To Surge In Trading   Volumes The demand-supply gap led to increased volatility in the oil market throughout the 2016. The  oil prices  have continued to deviate in both directions as the global supplies continue to remain high. This propelled 29% year-to-date growth in energy derivative volumes for the three quarters of 2016. Since the outlook for the restricted production of oil remains uncertain, we expect the market volatility to sustain in the near term, thus promoting the growth in trading volumes.          Metals Continue To Be Favored As A Safe   Investment Under the effect of slowdown in Chinese economy in the prior year, the investors had continued to look for safer investment alternatives. Precious metals have attracted a lot of attention over this time frame. Furthermore, the news of Brexit caused the metal derivative volumes to shoot up even further. The company saw 34% growth in trading volumes in 2016.          Equities Likely To Pickup Pace With Improvement In   Macro-Conditions And Volatility With the uncertain macro conditions hovering throughout 2016, equities and foreign exchange derivative volumes have continued to decline. Moreover, the Brexit news led to a decline in Euro trading volumes and also affected the company's foreign currency reserves.       However, we expect them to recover in the current quarter with marked improvement in GDP, employment rate. The recently concluded U.S. presidential elections will possibly lead to increased volatility in the markets, with investors trying to assess the impact of Donald Trumps's election on various industries and accordingly take positions in the companies' stocks.Notes:1) The purpose of these analyses is to help readers focus on a few important things. We hope such lean communication sparks thinking, and encourages readers to comment / ask questions on the comments section2) Figures mentioned are approximate values to help our readers remember the key concepts more intuitively.

MarketAxess' European trading business continues to grow. The company is gaining Eurobond market share and seeing healthy growth in trading volumes in emerging markets and U.S. credit products from European clients.Furthermore, Private Axes - a protocol that allows bond market participants to anonymously negotiate block trades to minimize information leakage - is another growth driver.

2018-07-13,10 Top Nasdaq Stocks to Buy Now,"Not all that long ago, a Nasdaq listing of a stock was met with a bit of derision. While it wasn't as lowly as the ""pink sheets,"" the up-and-coming exchange - which was more of a telecommunications network and less of an actual trading floor - just didn't have street cred. Thus, Nasdaq stocks weren't taken as seriously as the tickers associated with the New York Stock Exchange.But a funny thing happened as the 1990s turned into the 2000s. Largely thanks to the explosive growth of Microsoft ( MSFT ) and Apple ( AAPL ) - both of which were listed on the Nasdaq exchange - the little tech-heavy exchange began to be recognized as the place where investors could participate in the technology evolution.The rest, as they say, is history.Little has changed in the meantime. The Nasdaq still is a technology-oriented exchange, and still home to some of the stock market's most rewarding names. So rewarding, in fact, that they have driven the Nasdaq composite to numerous fresh highs in 2018.Here's a rundown of 10 of the most compelling Nasdaq stocks. Some are familiar, some not so much. In all cases, though, these companies offer something special their peers don't.Market value: $5.4 billionMost investors might not be familiar with MKS Instruments ( MKSI , $97.95), but Wall Street analysts certainly are, and they love what they see. It's one of the few Nasdaq stocks the professionals rater better than a buy, leaning toward a strong buy - the highest possible rating. Better still, the average analyst price target of $137 is a whopping 40% higher than the stock's current price.In May, Citi went so far as to name MKSI as its top mid-cap/small-cap in the technology fabrication equipment space.MKS Instruments, as the name suggests, makes a variety of scientific instruments. From optical gas analysis to pressure measurement to motion control, the company makes solutions the average consumer couldn't care less about - but that the average manufacturer can't live without.The results underscore that demand. MKS Instruments is expected to grow revenues by 14% this year, and the bottom line should expand at an even faster pace. For the record, MKSI has topped estimates in most of its recent quarters, by a lot.The kicker: With MKSI priced at less than 14 times trailing earnings and a forward-looking price-to-earnings ratio of about 10, MKSI is an unusual bargain amid technology stocks.Market value: $18.4 billionIf MKS Instruments is a growth machine, Abiomed ( ABMD , $414.61) is a growth factory. The company's revenues are expected to grow 29% this year, then at the same clip in 2019. Profits are even more peppy; last year's per-share profit of $2.45 is projected to reach $3.55 this year, then swell to $4.77 next year.Abiomed is the maker of a medical device that's earned the accolade ""game changer."" Its lineup of heart pumps, branded under the name Impella, are not only the smallest heart pumps in the world, but also one of the most technologically advanced. In February, the FDA approved an upgrade to the Impella CP, adding an optical pressure sensor to the device that makes it more effective and create more information about a patient's heart for caregivers.ABMD shares aren't cheap. The stock's 191% rally over the past 12 months has driven shares to a frothy valuation; even with strong earnings growth on tap, the forward P/E of 87 is tough to swallow. But this might be a case where the hype and potential of the Impella device, three years down the road, still puts it among Nasdaq stocks you should add to your watchlist.Market value: $15.6 billionHere's an appropriate coincidence: The exchange where many great-but-overlooked stocks trade is a great investment in and of itself.The company is simply called Nasdaq Inc. ( NDAQ , $93.37), and it's not just focused on its U.S. exchange. Nasdaq operates more than 90 markets in 50 different countries, serving as the middleman for stocks, options, futures, commodities and more.That diverse revenue stream doesn't make Nasdaq immune to economic ebbs and flows. It's a small, inter-related world, and an economic cold contracted anywhere in the world can be felt everywhere else. Nevertheless, that diversity smooths out some of the rough edges.That's not even the clincher. The reason investors may want to step into Nasdaq is, for all the fear that seems and sounds prevalent about stocks right now, young companies still are hungry for funding, and investors still are hungry for new opportunities. Both parties are coming to Nasdaq to make it happen, more than ever. The exchange added 151 new listings during the first half of this year, and as of the end of the second quarter, Nasdaq has been the IPO leader for 18 consecutive months. More listings mean more fee revenue.As long as the global economy continues to move forward, Nasdaq has an edge.Market value: $28.1 billionThe prospects of an all-out trade war between China and the United States have terrified investors. They've been particularly haunting for technology investors because disputes about intellectual property have been particularly tense. In short, both countries have been increasingly hesitant to let the other have access to certain pieces of critical hardware.Lam Research ( LRCX , $171.32), however, may not be as vulnerable to the geopolitical spat as it might seem.Moody's Senior Vice President Richard Lane made the call in late June, flatly noting, ""China's tariffs and/or trade restrictions would have only a limited impact on Applied Materials Inc., Lam Research Corp. and KLA-Tencor Corp., since indigenous Chinese customers represent just 6%, or $1.8 billion, of their annual aggregate revenue."" Lane also said non-Chinese customers will drive plenty of revenue for these outfits for the foreseeable future.Lam Research, by the way, isn't so much a technology maker as it is a company that allows more conventional tech companies make their wares. Its wafer fabrication equipment , for instance, allows chipmakers such as Intel ( INTC ) and Advanced Micro Devices ( AMD ) to make ever-better computing solutions.It's still subject to the cyclical nature of technology, but much less so than other technology players. The race among chipmakers to offer the fastest, smallest chips never really stops, setting the stage for consistent revenue.Market value: $765.1 millionThe solar-power investing movement mostly fell off the radar a few years back, following a frenzied 2008 that turned many of the industry's publicly traded companies into temporary heroes. That's especially true of Canadian solar panel makers such as Canadian Solar ( CSIQ , $13.06), which doesn't enjoy the benefit of being squarely in U.S. investors' sights.Solar isn't fading into the background, nor will it become just a footnote in the world's history of energy. A projected 104 gigawatts worth of solar power production capacity should be installed this year, with similar installations expected every year through 2022.Canadian Solar - one of the survivors of solar's post-2008 headwind - may well be the proverbial gold standard in the business. Not only is it still innovating, creating wares like more efficient bifacial panels, but it's also doing development deals with partners that should theoretically be making their own panels. Case in point: Japan's Yamaguchi Shin Mine solar power project tapped Canadian Solar as the supplier of the panels used in the 56-megawatt facility.The distant future rarely looks all that bright for Canadian Solar (or its peers). Prospects tend to turn into buyers on a last-minute basis, however, setting the stage for significant long-term, even if uneven, revenue and income growth. Analysts are looking for 25% sales growth this year .Market value: $124.8 billionThink Adobe ( ADBE , $248.12) is just the company that pioneered the Portable Document Format (PDF), making it easy for web users to view and handle identical copies of documents? Think again. Adobe's Acrobat is arguably the least important piece of its portfolio now. Adobe is a full-blown digital marketing company, with some pretty impressive tools to offer current and prospective customers.Morningstar analyst Ali Mogharabi explains, ""While Adobe was not the first mover in marketing software (now dubbed Experience Cloud), an argument can be made that it is the leader."" He adds, ""While we believe there are some companies whose needs may not align with Adobe's marketing value proposition, we think there is plenty of room for multiple large-scale winners in the marketing cloud, with Adobe having an inside track.""The fiscal numbers agree with that thesis. Analysts collectively expect sales to soar to the tune of 22% this year , followed by 19% growth next year. Profits are expected to grow at an even faster clip. (And for the record, Adobe hasn't missed a single quarterly earnings estimate in the past three years.)ADBE shares aren't cheap, at 33 times next year's expected earnings. But you have to pay for quality.Market value: $800.5 billionMicrosoft ( MSFT , $101.98) needs no introduction or explanation. The software giant was the heart and soul of the advent of the personal computer, and then the internet itself. While the introduction of mobile devices - and mobile internet in particular - has since made Microsoft's software less relevant than it used to be, the company has reinvented itself into something perhaps even more marketable than it used to be.The reinvented Microsoft is a cloud-centric company. Although the company doesn't pinpoint exactly how much revenue that cloud computing generates, last quarter, Office 365 (its legacy productivity software, in a cloud-based subscription format) for commercial clients saw revenue growth of 14%. The consumer-oriented version helped drive 12% growth in that arm's cloud revenue. Microsoft Azure, which is the company's enterprise-level cloud platform, saw a 93% year-over-year improvement in sales a quarter ago.It's also noteworthy that as of the first quarter, Microsoft eclipsed Amazon.com ( AMZN ) in terms of cloud computing revenue.That matters. As much as the world has made good use of the cloud and all the flexibility that comes with it, we've only scratched the surface. IT research outfit Gartner predicts that the total public cloud computing market will exceed $400 billion by 2020, up from last year's $260 billion.Market value: $3.3 billionWhile most everyone's heard of Microsoft, many people likely haven't heard of FireEye ( FEYE , $16.90). Still, it's one of those Nasdaq stocks worthy of a closer look.FireEye offers a suite of cybersecurity solutions, primarily offered to enterprise-level customers. But it's more than just a collection of firewalls and malware detection tools. FireEye provides services like iSIGHT, which can identify and predict a potential threat to a network before it becomes an actual problem.There is one significant red flag that casts a shadow on the stock: FireEye isn't profitable. It's not even close. A series of acquisitions made over the course of the past several years - before demand for security-as-a-service platforms had gelled - made things fiscally tough for FireEye. A closer inspection of the revenue and income trend, however, suggests a swing to a profit is in sight. Analysts expect the company to turn last year's per-share loss of 16 cents into a 2-cent profit this year, then ramp it up to 17 cents in per-share earnings in 2019.This trend, and this product lineup, prodded Piper Jaffray to upgrade FEYE just a few days before this writing. Analyst Andrew Nowinski wrote, ""Our channel contacts noted that the new pricing bundles are having a positive impact on overall demand trends, which we believe is sustainable and will drive positive operating income and free cash flow starting in (the third quarter of 2018).""Market value: $2.8 billionNuVasive ( NUVA , $54.01) isn't exactly a heavyweight, even within the medical equipment world where it resides. It's also not exactly a fast grower; this year's revenue is only expected to improve by 7%, and that pace will likely slow to less than 6% next year.However, this company has commanding control of its relatively small niche - more than enough control to make it worthy of adding to a watchlist.NuVasive offers spinal surgery solutions. Not only does it create innovate surgical equipment, but it develops the specific procedures to make use of them. Its XLIF procedure is the world's only lateral-approach spinal surgery procedure, made better by improvements like the use of 3D-printed porous titanium implant based on the porous PEEK (polyether ether ketone) technologies it garnered when it acquired Vertera Spine late last year. The modest tweaks and improvement, in sum, keep NuVasive on the cutting edge of the small but reliable spinal surgery market.The past 12 months haven't been stellar. While the Nasdaq has roared ahead by nearly 25%, NUVA shares are off by almost 30% as investors have sought out faster-growing companies. Given Nuvasive's steady, reliable earnings growth though, shares are falling back into favor.Market value: $60.5 billionLast but not least, add another biopharma name to a list of Nasdaq stocks that too many people are overlooking: Celgene ( CELG , $83.33).Like Nuvasive, Celgene shares have struggled of late. The stock is down roughly 20% year-to-date, unable to escape from the broad downtrend that has dragged most of the industry lower.But this is a case where investors proverbially threw the baby out with the bathwater. Revenue is on pace to grow nearly 15% this year, and the pros are looking for the top line to swell another 12% next year, largely on the heels of strong growth of Revlimid sales. Revenue driven by the cancer drug grew 19% a quarter ago, and the organization's guidance says it's looking for more of the same kind of growth from its breadwinner going forward.Where Celgene is really starting to shine now that Revlimid is firing on all cylinders, however, is on the earnings growth front. Last year's per-share earnings are projected to reach $8.53 this year, then grow to $10.21 per share next year. With that double-digit earnings growth pace on the table, the forward-looking P/E of 8.2 is arguably a huge bargain.For the record, CELG shares have gained nearly 10% from their June lows, implying investors are starting to realize Celgene shares were unduly punished.

2017-02-06,Nasdaq Inc. Enjoys Record Revenue and Reshuffles Its Business Segments,"The impact from recent acquisitions continues to boost the top   line of   Nasdaq Inc.    (NASDAQ: NDAQ) , which released its fourth-quarter 2016 earnings   report on Jan. 31. However, net income swung to a loss as the   company recorded a non-cash impairment charge in its fixed-income   business.Nasdaq also announced changes to its reporting segments as   newly appointed CEO Adena Friedman wasted no time in tweaking the   exchange operator's business model. We'll review these and other   details from the quarter, after a summary review of earnings   results directly below.           Image source: Getty Images.                       Data source: Nasdaq Inc.Friedman took the opportunity on her first earnings call with   analysts to provide her key execution priorities for 2017. Given   the transition in management, it's worth quoting these priorities   in full:First is to remain intently focused on completing the     integrations of the 2016 acquisitions, so that we can provide     the full benefits of these investments to our clients and     shareholders. As of the end of the fourth quarter in 2016,     we've achieved $38 million in realized run rate cost synergies,     and we continue to have high confidence we can deliver the full     $60 million total by the end of 2017.Second is to commercialize emerging technologies in     meaningful ways, for our clients and shareholders. Most notably     in the areas of machine intelligence, blockchain, and the     cloud. Leveraging our investments in the Nasdaq Financial     Framework and the new trading and analytics platform, we will     progress our commercial offerings in areas where we have the     most compelling client opportunities.Third is to improve our competitive positioning across all     of our core businesses through continuous innovation and     best-in-class client service. In my view, client-centric     innovation and service, coupled with a return orientation to     our investments, are the best means to secure our future     growth.In essence, Friedman's approach, at least initially, won't   differ markedly from that of her predecessor. Nasdaq will be   focusing on some familiar themes: Completing acquisition   integration tasks efficiently; investing heavily in technology,   especially within non-trading platforms; and generating new   products and services to differentiate itself from exchange and   services competitors.Of the points Friedman listed above, the first may be most   important in the near term. While Nasdaq is obviously benefiting   from its merger activity, the costs of acquiring revenue still   pose immediate challenges. Peeling away the $528 million non-cash   impairment charge discussed above, Nasdaq's fourth-quarter   operating income margin declined by roughly 10 percentage points,   to 35.5%, versus the comparable quarter in 2015.Nasdaq attributes the expense to both acquisition closing   costs and ongoing merger and strategic initiative costs. As the   company continues to realize synergies from its transactions, and   completes merger integration initiatives, expenses should begin   to normalize relative to trading and service revenue. Thus,   shareholders may want to keep an expectant eye out for operating   margin improvement over the coming quarters.          10 stocks we like better than Nasdaq            When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

2018-05-30,How to Play Blockchain Without Getting Burned,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe word ""blockchain"" is one of the most misunderstood terms in the market today. There is certainly a connection between it and bitcoin, but the two words are far from synonymous. Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency that is based on blockchain technology, while blockchain is a ledger of records and transactions called blocks that are linked and secure.Blockchain technology has the potential to change the world similar to the way the internet did back in the 1990s. It can be implemented in nearly every industry - ranging from real estate to the financials - and it can even be used to track coffee from a farm in South America to the local coffee shop down the street.This technology will make everyday transactions faster, cheap and more efficient - it's a win-win for everyone involved.There are several ways to play the future of blockchain, which in my opinion will not only revolutionize and disrupt a large number of industries but also lead to trillions of dollars in innovation in the decades ahead. The first is to invest in the specific cryptocurrencies, like bitcoin, that will likely emerge as the leaders in the sector once all the dust settles. However, this strategy tends to be viewed as extremely high on the risk scale, so it's not so easy for most investors.That's perfectly fine - cryptocurrencies are certainly not for everyone. Another way to play trend is to look at the publicly traded companies that are leading the blockchain revolution. However, because there are very few reputable pure play blockchain stocks in the market today, you have to make sure you're doing all your research.Let me explain: IBM  (NYSE: IBM ) is one of the blockchain leaders, but the issue here is that the rest of the company's business makes up the majority of revenue. The blockchain portion remains very small, so you wouldn't be gaining much exposure here.Your best option is to look at the financial industry, as it is already implementing blockchain technology into its current functions. Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc.  (NYSE: BR ) is the leader in investor communications for most large publicly traded companies and it has already begun testing the use of blockchain in its proxy voting and facilitating transactions for large banks.So far, the results have been great, and the stock hit a new all-time high earlier this month.Another company at the forefront of blockchain and technology in general is Nasdaq Inc  (NASDAQ: NDAQ ), and it has also recently hit a new high as a result of its positioning in the space. The company's openness to incorporating blockchain - in the last earnings conference call it was mentioned that NDAQ is open to creating a crypto exchange - separates it from its peers, and I suspect it will keep driving the stock higher over time.The blockchain revolution is still in its infancy and therefore requires patience from long-term investors. There is no need to risk it all on a penny stock that recently added the word ""blockchain"" to its name. Instead, look for solid companies that are pivoting to the technology and have the potential to become leaders in the space.It may take a few years, but your patience will be rewarded in the end.Matthew McCall is the founder and president of Penn Financial Group, an investment advisory firm, as well as the editor of FUTR Stocks and the ETF Bulletin.

2017-01-23,Will Discover Financial (DFS) Stock Rally Post Q4 Earnings?,"We expect Discover Financial Services  DFS  to beat earnings expectations when it reports its fourth-quarter and full-year 2016 results,   after the market closes  tomorrow.       Zacks Rank   : Discover Financial carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Note that stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) and 3 have a significantly higher chance of beating earnings.     The combination of Discover Financial's Zacks Rank #3 and ESP of +0.73% makes us confident of an earnings beat on Jan 24. Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.38 reflects a year-over-year increase of 21.2%.     What to Expect?      The company's quarterly results should benefit from growing loans. It's continued focus on pursuing new card accounts and wallet share gains from existing customers, through investments in marketing and rewards as well as new card features should contribute to card business revenues.     Apart from the credit card loans, its portfolio also consists of personal loans and private student loans. Given the company's efforts on product enhancements and marketing, management remains confidents to witness record originations in student and personal loans for 2016. Total loan growth is expected to be in the range of 4-6% for 2016.     Diners Club volume is also expected to have seen strong growth in the Asia Pacific region.     However, results may reflect impact from higher credit card rewards rate and increased credit loss reserve.     Net interest margin is likely to be relatively flat. Though the company is modestly asset sensitive, the December rate hike is not expected to exhibit material impact on margin.     Regarding expenses, the company is likely to have witnessed a rise in expenses due to several marketing and business development initiatives undertaken during the fourth quarter.     Stocks That Warrant a Look      Here are some stocks worth considering, as they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.     Nasdaq, Inc. NDAQ  is scheduled to release results on Jan 31. It has an Earnings ESP of +1.06% and carries a Zacks Rank #3.     CME Group Inc. CME  is slated to release results on Feb 2.

2018-02-14,What Are CME's Key Sources of Revenue?,"We have a $146 price estimate for CME's stock  , which is below the current market price. We expect the company's overall revenues to grow by around 5% in 2018. Our interactive dashboard  shows the historical trends and our expectations for the company's FY'18 top line; you can modify the key value drivers to see how they impact the company's revenues.   Interest Rate Derivatives Continued To Grow Under Fed   Guidance Interest rate derivatives have been the highest in terms of trading volumes and revenue contribution, with over 8% annual revenue growth. The uncertainty around macro conditions and Fed's indication of interest rate hikes and consequent hikes led to a significant increase in derivative volumes throughout the period.          Oil Prices Have Led To Improved Volumes The demand-supply gap led to increased volatility in the oil market throughout the last 5 years. Oil prices have continued to fluctuate due to OPEC's stance on capping production. This propelled 11% and 7% annual growth in energy derivative volumes and revenue, respectively. Since the outlook for the restricted production of oil remains uncertain, we expect the market volatility to sustain in the near term, thus leading to continued growth in trading volumes.

Long-term debt of $2.23 billion as of Mar 31, 2017, remained largely flat with the prior-year period.     As of Mar 31, 2017, the company had total assets worth $75.5 billion, up from $69.4 billion at year-end 2016.     The company paid dividends worth $1.3 billion in the quarter.     Our Take      CME Group's results reflect a solid performance. The company remains well positioned for growth given its strong market position with diverse derivative product lines. Efforts to expand and cross-sell core exchange-traded business through strategic alliances & acquisitions, new product initiatives and global reach further support growth.

2018-01-31,Nasdaq's (NDAQ) 4th Quarter Earnings Beat Powered By Market Services,"Nasdaq's (NDAQ) record-breaking 2017 officially ended Wednesday with its fourth straight earnings beat. And driven by higher revenues and growth across all segments of the business, it's showing no signs of slowing down.Thanks to strong performances in Market Services, which accounted for 35% of total revenue, Nasdaq topped Wall Street’s fourth quarter forecasts Wednesday, delivering a profit of $246 million, yielding a net income of $1.45 per share, reversing last year’s loss of $224 million, or $1.35 per share. On an adjusted basis, when taking out one-time gains and costs, earnings came to $1.05 per share. Not only was that 5 cents better than Street estimates, it marked a 10.5% jump from last year’s earnings of 95 cents per share.Revenue, excluding transaction-based expenses, rose 6% year over year to $635 million. The company’s string of strategic deals, aimed at boosting the top line, continue to pay off. During the quarter, some $7 million impact came from acquisitions. Together with $17 million, or 3% rise in organic growth and $12 million favorable impact from foreign exchange rates, lead to an Q4 revenue increase of $36 million from the same period a year ago.Notably, Q4 subscription and recurring revenues grew 8% year over year, marking a sequential growth acceleration of four percentage points from Q3. Just as impressive, the company’s two main segments are flexing much-needed muscle. Market Services, which accounted for 35% of total Q4 net revenues, posted revenue of $222 million, up $2 million year over year, while Corporate Services revenue came to $170 million, accounting for 27% of total net revenues.Ahead of the quarter, there were concerns that the company, which guided for higher Q4 operating expenses, would spend too much to deliver a beat. Expenses were expected to also impact profit margins as the company invests in areas to better diversify the business. But given the strong bottom-line beat, these costs were well managed.“We achieved strong results in the fourth quarter and full year of 2017 through an intense focus on our clients and strong execution against our business priorities,"" said CEO Adena Friedman in a statement. She added, ""We are building upon the success of 2017 by establishing three new execution priorities for 2018, including progressing our pivot to align with and maximize our opportunities as an innovative analytics and technology partner, developing and deploying our ‘markets economy’ technology strategy, and continuing to advance our competitive position in our core businesses.""In other words, the company, which crushed its competitors in 2017 with more than 130 IPOs, while the Nasdaq Composite Index surged 28% — rising faster than any other major U.S. index — plans to mash the accelerator in terms of innovation and other initiatives it believes can sustain its long-term success. And with synergies from strategic acquisitions still paying off, 2018 is poised to be another record-breaking year.

2017-09-20,Nasdaq Issues Notes Worth $500M to Fund eVestment Buyout,"Nasdaq, Inc.   NDAQ  announced that it will issue $500 million of senior notes due 2019. The offering is anticipated to close by Sep 22, 2017. The interest has been pegged at three-month U.S. dollar LIBOR plus 0.4% per annum.The company intends to utilize the net proceeds along with cash in hand and borrowings under the company's senior credit facility or through issuances of commercial paper to finance its eVestment buyout as well as the expenses associated with it.  Nasdaq will also utilize the funds for general corporate purposes if the eVestment acquisition does not materialize. On Sep 5, 2017 Nasdaq had announced that it will acquire eVestment for $705 million. The buyout is expected to culminate in the fourth quarter of 2017.The approach by Nasdaq to capitalize on the still-low interest rate environment to procure funds appears prudent. Also, this might lower the interest burden on borrowings, facilitating margin expansion.The company exited the last-reported quarter with its debt balance declining 15% from the 2016-end level. Long-term debt to equity ratio was 0.55 at quarter end, down 1100 basis points. With the new issuance, the long-term debt-to-equity ratio would increase 900 basis points.With the issuance, the company's interest burden will increase. However, solid operational performance will help it service debt uninterruptedly. The company has delivered positive surprise in the last three quarters. Notably, the company is focused to de-leverage over the next four quarters with effective capital deployment that in turn will strengthen its balance sheet.

While U.S. equity options volume expanded 23.1% year over year to 474 million contracts, European options and futures volumes were 22.3 million contracts in the quarter, up 2.8% year over year.

2017-07-30,3 Top Insurance ETFs,"Insurance has historically offered some of the best-performing   stocks in the financial industry. Today, then, let's consider   three insurance ETFs that offer diversified portfolios touching   on every type of insurance company -- property and casualty,   personal, commercial, life, reinsurance, and brokerages.Insurance ETFExpense Ratio           SPDR S&P Insurance ETF            (NYSEMKT: KIE)0.35%           iShares U.S. Insurance ETF            (NYSEMKT: IAK)0.44%           PowerShares KBW Property & Casualty Insurance           Portfolio ETF            (NYSEMKT: KBWP)0.35%Data source: ETF sponsors.Here's how each of these three insurance ETFs work, along with   the case for adding each one to your portfolio.           Image source: Getty Images.If diversification is what you're looking for, the SPDR   S&P Insurance ETF has it. This ETF holds shares of 50   publicly traded insurance companies, which are equally weighted   in the portfolio. Large or small, each company makes up 2% of the   fund when it's rebalanced each quarter.Equal-weighted funds tend to have a bias toward smaller   companies, but a $2 billion minimum market capitalization helps   keep the fund tilted toward mid-cap insurance stocks. At the time   of writing, mid-cap insurance companies made up approximately 58%   of the fund's asset value.           Image source: author.One perk of this ETF is that it invests in all things   insurance, even insurance brokers, which generate the majority of   their revenue and profit by marketing and selling policies,   rather than taking on the risk of a policy. Depending on how   you'd like to tackle investing in the insurance industry, this   could be a pro or a con.Given the fund's equal weighting, it's my view that this ETF   is best for investors who want broad diversification and the   opportunity to profit as the industry consolidates. Because fund   holdings are equally weighted, it is more heavily invested in   companies that would make bite-size acquisitions for larger   industry participants. For that reason, this fund is likely to   perform best when merger and acquisition activity picks up in the   insurance industry. Notably, merger and acquisition activity in   the insurance industry has picked up in recent years, as foreign   insurers -- Japanese insurers, specifically -- look to the U.S.   to find growth.The iShares U.S. Insurance ETF is a good fit for investors who   want access to a portfolio of primarily large-cap insurance   stocks. The iShares U.S. Insurance ETF is   market-cap    weighted and holds 62 different companies at the time of   writing.However, because the insurance industry has just a handful of   publicly traded giants, the largest companies in the industry   make up the majority of the fund's assets. At the time of   writing, its 10 largest holdings made up 60% of the portfolio,   thus making this a large cap-biased insurance ETF.           Image source: author.The ETF tracks the Dow Jones U.S. Select Insurance Index,   which includes companies that are selected by committee. To enter   the index, companies must have a minimum market cap of $500   million, and they must maintain a minimum cap of $250 million to   remain. According to its methodology, the index includes   ""full-line insurance companies, property and casualty insurance   companies, and life insurance companies.""While one might view its concentrated portfolio and large-cap   focus as negatives, the truth is that this is the closest thing   to a ""true"" insurance-sector ETF. The largest and most popular   sector ETFs    are market-cap weighted and thus have similar biases to large-cap   companies.PowerShares KBW Property & Casualty Insurance Portfolio is   the ETF for investors who want to invest in property and casualty   insurers exclusively. The ETF tracks the KBW Nasdaq Property   & Casualty Index, which is a modified market   capitalization-weighted index currently consisting of 24 property   and casualty insurance companies selected by a five-member   committee.To be included in the underlying index and ETF, companies must   be ""primarily engaged in property and casualty insurance   activities""; trade on the NYSE, NYSE MKT, or   Nasdaq    ; and have average daily trading volume of at least 100,000   shares, among other rules.The index and ETF use a modified market-cap weighting so that   no holding makes up more than 8% of assets, and so that no more   than five holdings make up 8% each. All other positions are   capped at 4% of the portfolio. As a result, the five largest   holdings make up approximately 39.5% of the portfolio, and the 10   largest make up approximately 60%.Property and casualty insurers have historically been some of   the insurance industry's best performers, because they tend to   write short-term insurance contracts such as auto, homeowners,   and workers' compensation policies that are generally less risky   than long-term life or long-term care insurance policies are.   Property and casualty insurers tend to make   good investments    in rising rate environments, as short-term rates drive their   earnings from their investment portfolios.While these three ETFs do an excellent job providing low-cost   exposure to different corners of the insurance world, they leave   out what is arguably one of the market's largest and   best-performing insurance companies of all time:   Berkshire Hathaway    .While it's true that Warren Buffett's company isn't just an   insurance company -- it also owns one of the largest railroads   and utility businesses, among other companies -- Berkshire   derives a   substantial portion    of its profit from its insurance businesses. (Curiously,   the SPDR S&P Insurance ETF holds shares of   Fidelity National Financial    , which is a title insurer that operates some restaurants on the   side. It's hard to draw the lines on just how ""pure"" an insurer   must be to be an insurance company.)On one hand, excluding Berkshire is a testament to the fact   that each ETF is designed to invest in pure-play insurance   companies. On the other hand, those who buy one of the ETFs   mentioned here may want to complement their holdings with a few   shares of Berkshire Hathaway, given that it's the owner of the   largest and most profitable property-and-casualty and reinsurance   companies in the world.

2017-02-07,CBOE Holdings (CBOE) Beats on Q4 Earnings and Revenues,"CBOE Holdings, Inc.  CBOE  reported fourth-quarter 2016 adjusted earnings of 63 cents per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 60 cents. Also, the bottom line increased 7% year over year.                  FindTheCompany | Graphiq   On a GAAP basis, net income allocated to common stockholders was $44.7 million or 55 cents per share, compared with $50.2 million or 61 cents per share in the prior-year quarter.     For 2016, adjusted net income allocated to common stockholders came in at $197.3 million or $2.42 per share, as against $198.9 million or $2.40 per share in 2015. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2016 was $2.39.     Edward T. Tilly, CBOE Holdings' Chief Executive Officer, stated, ""The fourth quarter capped off another year of solid financial results for CBOE Holdings, highlighted by record trading in our SPX options and VIX futures.  In addition, we are closer to completing our pending acquisition of Bats Global Markets BATS  , which we now expect to close by the end of the first quarter, pending the receipt of certain regulatory approvals and the satisfaction or waiver of customary closing conditions.""     Operational Details      Operating revenue of $645.1 million in 2016 surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $642.4 million. Also, revenues increased 2% year over year.     For fourth-quarter 2016, total operating revenue came in at $163.2 million, outpacing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $160.5 million. Further, revenue was up 5% year over year. On an adjusted basis, it increased 6%. The increases were primarily driven by higher transaction fees as well as market data fees.     Total trading volume of CBOE Holdings climbed 13% year over year to 305.8 million contracts. Average revenue per contract (RPC) declined 8% year over year to 37.7 cents. The decline was mainly due to higher volume discounts and incentives.     Total operating expenses increased 10% year over year to $88.1 million, primarily due to higher professional fees and outside services, royalty fees and compensation and benefits. The increase was partially offset by reduced depreciation and amortization. On adjusted basis, expenses increased 4% from the prior-year quarter.     Adjusted operating margin expanded 90 basis points year over year to 46%.     Financial Update      As of Dec 31, 2016, CBOE Holdings had cash and cash equivalents of $97.3 million, down from $102.3 million at the end of 2015. Total assets came in at $477.2 million at the end of Dec 2016, up from $384.8 million at year-end 2015.     Long-term liabilities rose to $61.2 million from $51.1 million at year-end 2015. Total shareholders' equity was $317.9 million at the end of the reported quarter as against $259.6 million as of Dec 31, 2015.     Net operating cash flow dipped 6% year over year to $229.6 million in 2016.     Share Repurchase Update      CBOE Holdings did not buy back any shares during the reported quarter due to its proposed transaction with Bats Global. However, during 2016, the company repurchased 947,786 shares of its common stock at an average price of $63.83 per share.     2017 Outlook      Core operating expenses are expected in the range of $214-$218 million, reflecting an increase of 3-5% compared with 2016.     Depreciation and amortization expenses are projected in the range of $40-42 million. Capital expenditures are estimated in the range of $46-$48 million, reflecting the company's ongoing investments in systems hardware and software, in a bid to support and enhance its trading technology.     Stock-based compensation expense (included in core expenses) is likely to be about $27.5 million. Accelerated stock-based compensation expenses are projected to be about $13 million in the year, of which about $12 million is expected to be recognized in first-quarter 2017. The effective tax rate will likely be within 38.5-39.5%.     Notably, the guidance does not consider the company's planned acquisition of Bats Global. It expects the acquisition to be accretive to adjusted diluted EPS in the first year, following the closure, and intends to update guidance for full-year 2017 post acquisition.         Our Take      Results of CBOE Holdings reflect a decent performance. The company remains well poised for growth given its focus on expansion of its proprietary product offering, while extending its global customer reach. Diversified product portfolio and core competencies fuel its growth prospects. Additionally, the company is set to benefit from the Bats Global acquisition.        CBOE Holdings, Inc.

We wait to see how the stock fares after the first-quarter earnings release.     Earnings Whispers      Our proven model does not conclusively show that Nasdaq is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below.

2018-03-29,"Nasdaq Shares More Profit With Shareholders, Hikes Dividend","In its concerted efforts to enhance shareholder value, the board of directors of Nasdaq, Inc.NDAQ has recently hiked its quarterly dividend by 16%. The new dividend payout amounts to 44 cents per share compared with 38 cents paid earlier. Shareholders of record as of Jun 15 are expected to get the dividend on Jun 29. The annualized dividend of $1.76 yields 2.1%, based on the closing price of $83.49 as of Mar 28. This is better than the yield of 1.5% for the Zacks Securities Exchange industry. The recent dividend raise marks the fourth straight increase by the company at a four-year CAGR of 35.6%. Nasdaq boasts a healthy balance sheet and a strong cash position but modest operating cash flow from its diverse business model. A solid financial position ensures shareholder-friendly moves like higher dividend rates and share repurchases. Despite completing several acquisitions, Nasdaq returned almost $446 million in capital to shareholders in 2017 through dividends and repurchases, constituting 65% of its non-GAAP income. Based on 196.7 million shares outstanding at 2017-end, the company is likely to pay about $86.5 million in dividend annually. Nasdaq had $226 million remained outstanding under its authorized share buyback program as of Dec 31, 2017. Also, the company is authorized to repurchase shares worth $500 million. Nasdaq's consistent endeavors to improve shareholders' value make this stock an attractive pick for yield-seeking investors. The company remains committed to deploy capital effectively by de-leveraging, investing in organic growth initiatives, pursuing strategic acquisitions, increasing dividend and engaging in buybacks. Shares of Nasdaq have gained 9.2%, outperforming the industry 's 4.4% increase.

2017-04-08,3 Ways to Invest in Blockchain Technology Without Buying Bitcoins,"Investors in bitcoin have enjoyed an incredible year. Twelve   months ago, the price for one unit of the cryptocurrency stood at   just about $420. As I write, one bitcoin trades for $1,045 -- an   approximate 149% gain in just one year.However, the dramatic rise in   bitcoin    over the past year doesn't begin to tell the story of its   volatile trading history. In late 2013, the trading price for one   bitcoin was over $1,100. By January 2015, the price had plunged   again, this time to under $200. Following this incredible drop,   the digital monetary unit began its current meteoric rise. This   instability is inherent in investing in a currency that is not   backed or regulated by any national government, or based on   something of tangible value, like gold. Check out this chart   showing bitcoin fluctuations.                          ^NYB    data by   YCharts   It's not just the currency's stomach-churning volatility that   turns some people off from   investing in bitcoin    . The lack of regulation or palpable value behind the currency   causes many people to consider bitcoin somewhat akin to   Monopoly    money. On the other hand, the blockchain technology behind   bitcoin has a chance to be disruptive across so many different   industries and investors might be more willing to get behind   that.Blockchain technology is essentially a publicly distributed   ledger. When transactions using this technology are completed,   they are recorded on the newest ""block."" When a block's capacity   is filled, it is added to the end of the ""chain"" in linear order.   This way of transferring money, supplies, or other assets   eliminates the need for each transaction to go through various   middlemen, like brokerages, payment processors, and even banks.   The fewer third-parties involved in facilitating transactions,   the fewer players that take a small cut.Here are three companies that clearly see many opportunities   ahead for this potentially transformative technology, and that   are working to incorporate it in their respective fields.           Image source: Getty Images.Count   Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc.    (NYSE: BR) CEO Rich Daly among those who see the opportunities   for blockchain technology in finance. Last summer,   Daly wrote in   Forbes       :Some people know blockchain as the underlying technology     behind the controversial digital currency Bitcoin. However,     blockchain is so much more; it's incredibly innovative and its     promise is far-reaching. This technology is a secure and     transparent way to digitally track the ownership of assets     before, during and after transactions, and it has the potential     to ultimately transform everything from how stock exchanges     operate to how proxies are voted.Broadridge Financial handles mundane tasks for brokerages and   financial institutions such as facilitating proxy votes and   processing equity trades. The company believes blockchain   technology can streamline these processes, making them faster,   cheaper, and more secure.In the same editorial quoted above, Daly lists syndicated   loans as an example where blockchain technology would accomplish   these goals. Syndicated loans, Daly states, currently take up to   20 days to settle in a labor-intensive process. With blockchain,   the process would be much faster and would cost less in legal   fees and to close.Last September,   Broadridge made its latest investment    in this space, buying the technology assets of Inveshare, Inc.   for a total of $135 million. The acquisition was for the sole   purpose of accelerating Broadridge's use of blockchain technology   in its proxy business.   Nasdaq, Inc.    (NASDAQ: NDAQ) is the world's second largest stock exchange and   has been experimenting with blockchain technology for years. In   the final days of 2015,      Nasdaq announced    it had completed the first issuing of a private company's shares   to an investor via blockchain technology on the company's Linq   platform.The use of blockchain technology eliminated the need to issue   paper stock certificates and ""significantly"" reduced the   transaction's settlement time, according to Nasdaq, which   believes the technology holds the same promise for stocks sold on   the public markets. In the press release announcing the historic   transaction, Nasdaq CEO Bob Greifeld said:Through this initial application of blockchain technology,     we begin a process that could revolutionize the core of capital     markets infrastructure systems. The implications for settlement     and outdated administrative functions are profound.This isn't the only way Nasdaq has experimented with using   blockchain technology. Earlier this year, the company   successfully used the technology to      process proxy voting    on its Estonian exchange. It is now contemplating whether to use   the same process for proxy voting across all of its   exchanges.Perhaps no company has more invested in blockchain technology   than   International Business Machines Corp.    (NYSE: IBM) . The company just launched IBM Blockchain, a   platform that will enable enterprise customers to build   applications in IBM's cloud using blockchain. The company   believes its cloud-based blockchain offerings -- a type of   blockchain-as-a-service -- will differentiate it from its many   cloud competitors.           Image source: International Business Machines Corp.CEO Ginni Rometty believes it cannot be overestimated how   important blockchain technology is to the company's future. In   the company's 2016   annual letter    , she stated:Blockchain brings together shared ledgers with smart     contracts to allow the secure transfer of any asset -- whether     a physical asset like a shipping container, a financial asset     like a bond or a digital asset like music -- across any     business network. Blockchain will do for trusted transactions     what the Internet did for information.Rometty says the company is currently working with over 400   clients on blockchain initiatives. These offerings are as diverse   as using the platform to work with   Wal-Mart Stores    to track food inventory, and with the London-based start-up   Everledger to track diamonds.Broadridge Financial, Nasdaq, and IBM are multibillion-dollar   companies with many moving parts. Their futures do not hinge on   blockchain technology, but each is aiming to use it in ways that   will cut costs, allow for faster service, or differentiate their   business services from competitors. All three companies are   avenues investors can explore to gain decent exposure to   blockchain technology without buying bitcoins.          10 stocks we like better than IBM            When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

2017-04-28,3 Things You Didn't Know About Frontier Communications Corporation,"Frontier Communications    (NASDAQ: FTR) has gone from a small regional player in the   pay-television and broadband space by buying   Verizon    's (NYSE: VZ) wireline business in California, Texas, and Florida   (CTF) for $10.54 billion.That major deal brought the company approximately 3.3 million   voice connections, 2.1 million broadband connections, and 1.2   million FiOS video subscribers. It was a transaction that the   company undertook to increase its scale as well as help it gain   efficiencies.That part of the CTF purchase has been successful, with   Frontier on track to save nearly $1.5 billion annually across its   entire operation. Both the Verizon deal and the associated cost   savings have been well covered in media, and investors even   casually following the brand know what's going on there.The company does, however, have a number of things that many   investors, even shareholders, may not know. Not every one of   these items will surprise everyone, but each one tells a piece of   Frontier's story that perhaps hasn't been covered as much as it   should have been.                    Image source:   YCharts.   Since the Verizon deal closed a little over a year ago,   Frontier has been struggling, and its share price has been going   steadily in the wrong direction. To keep the company in   compliance with the   Nasdaq    , where its share are listed, the company's board has authorized   a reverse split, which shareholders will vote on in May,   according to the company's   Q4 earnings release    .""The charter amendment will provide for a reverse stock-split   ratio between 1-for-10 and 1-for-25, with the board designating   the final ratio within 90 days after the charter amendment is   approved by stockholders,"" the company wrote. ""Concurrent with   the reverse stock split, the conversion ratio of Frontier's   Series A 11.125% Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock will   automatically be adjusted proportionately.""           Old-school landline phones are Frontier's second largest     source of revenue. Image source: Pixabay.While most analysts and journalists covering the company focus   on broadband and pay television subscriber counts, Frontier still   relies pretty heavily on revenue from what it call ""voice   services."" That category, which is what is now commonly referred   to as ""land lines,"" was the company's second largest category in   Q4.Voice services brought in $774 million for the period, behind   only data and internet services, which came in at just over $1   billion for the quarter. Like the company's cable and broadband   segments, its landline business has been shrinking as well,   dropping by $34 million in revenue from Q3 to Q4.While it's common in the wireless-phone space to offer   incentives to customers willing to switch providers, the tactic   is less common in cable and broadband. That may because in many   markets the incumbent carrier has never had any real competition,   and the alternatives, such as satellite, have chosen to use price   as their main marketing factor.Frontier, however, has often been willing to pony up for   customers willing to make the switch. Currently, it's running a   promotion in which new customers can receive an   Amazon.com    gift card for up to $400. To get that amount, the consumer will   need to bundle the company's top-tier cable and broadband   services, along with a phone line, but smaller amounts are   available at a variety of pricing tiers. In most cases, getting   the incentive requires agreeing to a two-year contract.Frontier Communications has seen its stock tumble over time,   and many investors simply dismiss the company then and there. But   the details of what's been happening with Frontier's business   give a lot of insight into the reasons behind the slide, and that   can be helpful for shareholders thinking about what to do   next.          10 stocks we like better than Frontier     Communications            When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Mexico also plans to impose a 20% duty on pork starting Thursday while China is expected to raise the price of pork arriving into the company in addition to a 25% tariff on US soybeans beginning on Friday. The Financial Times, citing a letter sent the US Commerce Department, Monday reported the European Commission is preparing another $300 million in tariffs on US goods if the Trump White House moves ahead with its threatened tariffs on EU auto imports.

2018-07-05,"Seeking Belt buckle role, Kazakhstan launches China-backed financial hub","ASTANA, July 5 (Reuters) - Seeking to attract more foreign investment from its prime position in China's huge Belt and Road trade project, Kazakhstan launched a new financial hub on Thursday which has already secured the backing of its giant neighbour.The Astana International Financial Centre (AIFC), a self-styled ""mid-shore"" special economic zone, hopes to attract players ranging from Chinese state funds to Swiss private banks by offering tax breaks, easy entry and a Common Law court.The move is part of Kazakhstan's ambition to become a Luxembourg-style intermediary between larger nations and a gateway for foreign investment across Central Asia.Modelled on the Dubai International Financial Centre, AIFC wants to host all sorts of market players: family offices, private banks, brokers, asset managers, Islamic finance institutions and fintech companies.Unlike DIFC though, AIFC will not require that its members maintain physical presence in the windswept Kazakh capital where temperatures range from -40 to +40 Celsius (-40 to 104 Fahrenheit).It will also charge much lower fees than the established hubs and offer 50-year tax breaks.Like DIFC, the Astana hub will employ its own court and arbitration centre staffed with British judges and barristers.In fact, it hopes that its dispute resolution services will be used even by outside companies such as regular Kazakh businesses which often complain about ordinary courts' lack of independence and integrity.An even greater ambition is to serve as an arbitration centre for contracts between Chinese and Russian companies, AIFC employees say. Some foreign investors have enquired about the possibility of using AIFC as a platform to invest in Uzbekistan. CHINESE BACKINGKazakhstan often refers to itself as the buckle in Beijing's Belt and Road project - Chinese President Xi Jinping's landmark scheme to build infrastructure to connect China to the rest of Asia and beyond.China has already demonstrated its support for the AIFC with both the Shanghai Stock Exchange and the state-run Silk Road Fund becoming shareholders of AIFC's Astana International Exchange (AIX) alongside Nasdaq.""The Shanghai Stock Exchange is a 25 percent shareholder and they are contributing staff and resources but more importantly they are providing a gateway for us to talk to Chinese funds, Chinese brokers,"" AIX chief executive Timothy Bennett, who has previously run New Zealand's NZX bourse, told Reuters.""On the regulatory level one of the big opportunities for us is RMB and the ability to trade, clear and settle in RMB and their help with the regulatory process around that is very beneficial.""Trading on the new exchange is likely to open in September or October with the listing of one of the three state-controlled companies  - Kazakhtelecom, the world's biggest uranium miner Kazatomprom  or flag carrier Air Astana - as part of the government's privatisation campaign.Bennett said AIX would seek to attract active investors rather than chase ratings of index providers such as MSCI which largely drive passive fund flows. SHALLOW LIQUIDITYSo far, Kazakhstan has little to show for it when it comes to stock market development. Daily equities trading has averaged just $11 million this year on the Almaty-based Kazakh Stock Exchange and most of the large Kazakh companies floated abroad have since delisted for various reasons.An earlier attempt to create a regional financial hub in Almaty, Kazakhstan's biggest city, has failed and some of the biggest Kazakh banks had to be bailed out after a property price crash triggered by the 2008 global crisis.AIX hopes to partly address the liquidity issue by linking up with Euroclear, Europe's largest securities settlement house for securities. The move means that foreigners looking to buy Kazakh securities will no longer need to open accounts with a Kazakh depository.Still, two stock exchanges in a country of 18 million is ""one too many"", a Western executive said privately as he attended the launch event which took place on the eve of the 78th birthday of President Nursultan Nazarbayev who has run Kazakhstan since 1989."
2017-01-31,"Nasdaq (NDAQ) Q4 Adjusted Earnings Beat, Revenue Up Y/Y","Nasdaq, Inc.  NDAQ  reported fourth-quarter 2016 adjusted earnings per share of 95 cents per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny. Also, the bottom line improved 7% year over year.                  FindTheCompany | Graphiq   On a GAAP basis, the company reported net loss of $224 million or a loss of $1.35 per share, compared with net income of $148 million or 88 cents per share, in the prior-year quarter.     Performance in Detail      Nasdaq's revenues of $599 million for the reported quarter increased 12% year over year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate was $599.8 million. The increase was driven by a $54-million positive impact from acquisitions.     Adjusted operating expenses were $324 million, up 13.7% year over year. This rise mainly reflects $29 million of incremental operating expenses from the acquisitions closed in 2016. Notably, the company expects 2017 non-GAAP operating expense in the range of $1.26-$1.31 billion.     Nasdaq realigned its reporting segments to combine Listing Services and Corporate Solutions into a new 'Corporate Services' segment, while Market Technology is now a separate segment. Also the company combined its U.S. and European fixed income products and services under a single brand called Nasdaq Fixed Income.     Segment wise, net revenues at    Market Services   jumped 12.8% from the year-ago quarter to $220 million. The rise was driven by higher revenues from the ISE and Nasdaq CXC acquisitions, partially offset by lower market share in the U.S. equity derivatives and U.S. cash equities businesses.     Revenues at    Corporate Services   climbed 16.8% year over year to $167 million. The increase mainly reflects inclusion of revenues from the Marketwired and Boardvantage acquisitions in the Corporate Solutions business as well as higher revenues from listing services.        Information Services   ' revenues rose 6.3% year over year to $135 million. Higher proprietary data products revenues and the inclusion of revenues from the acquisitions of ISE and Nasdaq CXC led to increased data products revenues. Additionally, revenues from index licensing and services increased from the prior-year quarter.     Revenues at    Market Technology   increased 8.5% year over year to $77 million, reflecting organic revenue growth.     During 2016, Market Technology order intake totaled $276 million. This includes $136 million in fourth-quarter 2016. The Nasdaq Stock Market witnessed 283 new listings during the year, including 91 IPOs.     As of Dec 31, 2016, Nasdaq achieved $38 million in annualized run-rate cost synergies for the acquisitions in 2016 out of the targeted $60 million.     Nasdaq had cash and cash equivalents of $403 million as of Dec 31, 2016. Net debt increased 55.1% over the 2015-end level to $3.2 billion.     Our Take      Nasdaq's results reflect decent performance. Growth looks encouraging as the company remains focused on expansion through acquisitions and organic initiatives that enable entry and cross-selling opportunities into new markets. Top line should also benefit from the company's consistent focus on its strategy to accelerate its non-transaction revenue base, which includes technology, listing and information revenues. However, higher expenses and stiff competition remain key concerns.   Nasdaq, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise                   Nasdaq, Inc.

2018-03-09,"The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights: Ulta, Ross, Anthem, General Dynamics and Nasdaq","For Immediate Release Chicago, IL - March 9, 2018 - Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include Ulta Beauty Inc.  ULTA  , Ross Stores Inc.  ROST  , Anthem Inc.  ANTM  , General Dynamics Corporation  GD  and Nasdaq Inc.  NDAQ  .   Here are highlights from Thursday's Analyst   Blog:         Women-Led Firms Outperform 9-Year Bull Run: 5 Top     Picks    With global awareness on gender diversity, the number of female corporate leaders has gone up in recent years. After dropping to 21 in 2016, the number of women CEOs on Fortune 500 increased more than 50% to a record 32 at the start of 2017. However, the number declined to 27 as of January 2018 and will drop further down to 24 by April. Despite this, women hold 21% of board seats at S&P 500 companies per Catalyst, a group researching women and work.Several researches show that the companies led by women have outperformed the market. According to analysis by the bank Nordea, companies with a woman in the chief executive or chairperson role have performed far better than a major global index over the past eight years. Annualized returns for female-led firms, based on an equal weighting, was 25% since 2009, compared with just 11% for the broader market - the MSCI World Index.The U.S. stock market is turning nine on Mar 9, representing the second-longest bull run in history after the 1990s rally that ended when the tech bubble burst in 2000. With regard to this, it is worth shedding light on the women leadership over this nine-year period and the outperformance of companies having female employees in top brass.The list of women CEO in the S&P 500 is still small at nearly 5% of the total. This does not, however, stop us from highlighting five stocks that are headed by women and have easily crushed the nine-year bull market.

2018-01-14,Why the Market Needs a Real Bitcoin ETF,"It's my view that bitcoin is the modern equivalent of Beanie   Babies, something people ""invest"" in under the premise that   someone else will be willing to pay an even higher price for it   later. It's a financial bubble in pure form, and making it easier   to buy bitcoin with an ETF would probably only add more fuel to   the fire.But I'm willing to admit that the alternative isn't much   better. Speculators eager to get their cryptocurrency fix are   turning to questionable securities that, in my view, will only   lead to worse outcomes than might result from investing in a   proper bitcoin ETF.Before writing off a bitcoin ETF as an unnecessary vehicle for   speculation, take into consideration how retail investors are   betting on cryptocurrencies today. One of the most popular stocks   at    online   discount broker    s is   Bitcoin Investment Trust    (NASDAQOTH: GBTC) , the closest thing to a bitcoin ETF on the   market right now.           Image source: Getty Images.The trust owns roughly 0.092 bitcoins per share outstanding,   but because it doesn't allow for easy creation or redemption, a   feature of ETFs, it often trades at a   ridiculous premium    to net asset value. On one half of trading days, it closed at a   price at least 42% higher than the value of the bitcoin it   owns.Even if you knew bitcoin would be worth 10% more tomorrow,   buying Bitcoin Investment Trust is an uncertain wager. On one day   in September, Bitcoin Investment Trust plunged by more than 20%,   even though the price of bitcoin increased about 2.5%. In   December, the trust soared 12.4% on a day when bitcoin declined   16%.Weird swings in price are hardly rare. On roughly one-third of   trading days, Bitcoin Investment Trust has moved in the   opposite direction of bitcoin    , making it almost as useful as a random number generator as it   is a bitcoin tracker. Lacking in any workable alternatives (like   a true bitcoin ETF), mom-and-pop investors have made it one of   the market's most actively traded bitcoin stocks by dollar   volume.Those who want to invest in cryptocurrencies through companies   that provide the picks and shovels to the bitcoin boom have a   suspect list of stocks to choose from. Questionable corporate   issuers are providing the supply to meet persistent demand for   all things bitcoin-related.   Riot Blockchain    (NASDAQ: RIOT) , a failed biotech company turned cryptocurrency   investor,   has a litany of red flags    , including a revolving door of executives and auditors, yet the   company raised $37 million selling warrants and common stock to   investors in December. Shortly after raising millions of dollars,   Riot announced it was adjourning its December 2017 annual meeting   until February.   Long Blockchain    , once a struggling beverage company known as Long Island Ice   Tea, has found new life as a bitcoin business. The company, which   would have been delisted from the   Nasdaq     marketplace if not for the fact it put ""blockchain"" in its   name, saw its share price soar high enough to meet the market's   rules on minimum market caps for listed companies, according to   Bloomberg    . It recently filed to raise $8.4 million in a stock offering to   buy 1,000 bitcoin mining machines, but has since reversed course,   announcing the news that it was dropping its plan to issue stock   on its website,   LongIslandIcedTea.com    . (It still plans to buy the mining hardware some way, though   with very little cash on hand, and limited financial backing,   it's hard to see how it will do that.)   Future FinTech Group    , a company that skirted a Nasdaq delisting notice by generating   a pop in its stock with news that it entered into an agreement to   produce a ""Globally Shared Shopping Mall blockchain software   system,"" is yet another company in a long list of   blockchain companies in name only    trading on SEC-regulated markets. Its corporate website still   shows bottles of juice on its homepage, a homage to its legacy   business of selling juices under the name ""Skypeople Fruit   Juice,"" which it ditched in June 2017.Finally, we have   Chinanet Online Holdings Inc.    , a company that soared on Jan. 4 after publishing a   buzzword-heavy press release that said it would ""gradually   shift from information services to transaction services for   business opportunities to create a multi-industry cross-chain   value-based internet sharing entity,"" whatever that means.   Details are few and far between on how it plans to turn a   money-losing online advertising business into a booming   cryptocurrency company, but one press release was enough to send   shares soaring nearly 1,000% at their peak after its   announcement.Relative to these four crypto stocks, all of which trade on an   SEC-regulated exchange, the Nasdaq, a true bitcoin ETF seems   benign. Yet the SEC has stood in the way of   bitcoin futures    -based ETFs, as Direxion, Exchange Listed Funds, and   ProShares have all withdrawn their proposals for a bitcoin ETF in   recent days, citing SEC concerns about them. Early last year, the   SEC similarly slapped down several   bitcoin ETFs    that planned to purchase bitcoin and hold it in much the same way   gold ETFs hold physical gold.The Securities and Exchange Commission is obviously aware of   the boom in questionable companies that are turning into ""bitcoin   companies"" overnight. The regulator's Fort Worth office recently   tweeted a joke about adding ""blockchain"" to its name to expand   its following.We're contemplating adding ""Blockchain"" to our name so we'll   increase our followers by 70,000 percent.   The SEC has an important role as the financial market's most   important regulator. On its website, it definines its role with a   three-part mission statement that includes:Allowing blockchain companies in name only to raise capital   freely while stymieing efforts to create a bitcoin ETF calls into   question whether the SEC is sending an implicit message that   questionable cryptocurrency stocks are somehow more legitimate   than bitcoin ETFs that would simply track the price of bitcoin,   up and down.

2017-11-03,Key Takeaways From IntercontinentalExchange's Q3,"The company's move to strengthen its Data Services segment worked well amid competitive pressure on the trading business, as the growth from this segment managed to boost the company's top line and margins (+3 percentage point year over year growth in operating margins). The company remains bullish on its Data Services segment, as these services are complementary to its core trading business, and a strong global footprint should drive sustained growth. Our expectation of nearly 5% growth from the segment for the full year is in line with the company's guidance.       Derivative Trading Volumes Saw Growth; Equities Remained   Under Pressure ICE's clearing and transaction fees, which contributed around 41% of its overall revenues, grew by nearly 5% from the prior year quarter. Among asset classes, the growth in financial derivatives was largely driven by the phenomenal growth (+36% y-o-y) in interest rate derivative volumes. With the expectations of another rate hike, we expect the growth momentum to sustain in the near term. Among commodities, energy derivatives saw a significant surge (+14% y-o-y). The market saw increased volatility in  oil prices  due OPEC's decision to cap production, which led to trading momentum.Equity options and cash equities suffered the most, with more than a 6% and 13% drop in trading volumes, respectively. As industry-wide volumes remained largely unchanged, the company's market share losses are a concern.   Data Services Continued Growth Due To Global Demand,   Acquisitions ICE's Data Services business generates around 45% of the company's overall revenues. This business grew by around 6% in the third quarter. With increasing demand for data-driven insights and analytics-driven recommendations, the company's acquisitions such as YellowJacket, NYSE, Interactive Data and TMX Atrium have helped it expand its market reach and add technological capabilities as well as new data and valuation services. As industry competition has intensified, the exchange's focus on strengthening its Data Services segment makes sense as a way to offset losses from declines in trading commissions.We currently have a price estimate of $69  for Intercontinental Exchange, which is slightly ahead of the current market price.Please refer to    the full Trefis analysis for Intercontinental   Exchange.

2017-10-24,Why Nasdaq (NDAQ) Might Surprise This Earnings Season?,"Investors are always looking for stocks that are poised to beat at earnings season and Nasdaq, Inc.NDAQ may be one such company. The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.That is because Nasdaqis seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings - with the most up-to-date information possible - is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for NDAQ in this report.In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at $1.03 cents per share for NDAQ, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.02 cents per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for NDAQ, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +0.49% heading into earnings season.Nasdaq, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Nasdaq, Inc. QuoteWhy is this Important?A positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises, and outperforming the market. Our recent 10-year backtest shows that stocks that have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better show a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and have returned over 28% on average in annual returns (see more Top Earnings ESP stocks here ).Given that NDAQ has a Zacks Rank #3 and an ESP in positive territory, investors might want to consider this stock ahead of earnings. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here .Clearly, recent earnings estimate revisions suggest that good things are ahead for (Company Name), and that a beat might be in the cards for the upcoming report.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

2018-06-12,Resurgent trading helped global exchanges' revenues hit record in 2017,"LONDON, June 12 (Reuters) - A surge in trading and booming demand for information services drove global exchange revenues to a record high in 2017, a report by consultancy Burton Taylor said on Tuesday.Total global exchange industry revenue rose 8.1 percent in 2017 to $30.744 billion, Burton Taylor, a subsidiary of TP ICAP, found.Intercontinental Exchange  retained the top spot in terms of revenue, followed by CME Group.Margins remained strong across the industry, reporting an average 53.6 percent EBIT (earnings before interest and tax) margin in 2017.Information services segments saw an average 9.1 percent increase in revenues as exchanges continued to push beyond real-time market data and into index and analytics services.Rising trading volumes and higher margin interest revenues helped boost revenues in trading, clearing and settlement (TC&S) - the largest industry segment - up 6.4 percent.CME Group remained the largest exchange for TC&S followed by Deutsche Boerse and Intercontinental Exchange (ICE).ICE held the biggest market share in the Americas while Deutsche Boerse was the biggest exchange in EMEA. Hong Kong Stock Exchange dominated the Asian market.In terms of regional market share, the Americas accounted for 38.9 percent of global revenues in 2017 with Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA) accounting for 36.6 percent and Asia 24.5 percent."
2017-02-09,ICE's Strong Q4 Driven By Increased Data Services Acquisitions And Recovery In Trading Volumes; Multiple Offerings To Ensure Growth Momentum In Future,"The fact that the company has a diverse product line will help it sustain its growth momentum in the year ahead.  It includes derivatives and equity products, along with the data services and risk management capabilities, all cashing in on the customer's growing demand.  Additionally, the company intends to introduce ""speed-bump"" seeing the traction gained by IEX, which is likely to eliminate the advantage for investors and traders involved in high-frequency trading. This will possibly help the exchange in gaining the market share ahead of Nasdaq, which is still vehemently opposing the application of speed-bump.Operating margins have gone down by 4 percentage points to around 48% for the year, primarily due to transaction and integration of the acquisitions it undertook over the year and Creditex customer relationship intangible asset impairment recorded in September 2016. As long as the company can ensure the consistent growth in top-line by a great percentage as witnessed in 2016, the decline in margins shouldn't be a cause of worry to the investors as the net income growth stayed at 12%.The company also generated operating cash flow of $2.1 billion in 2016, up 64% from the prior year. Around $1 billion was used to reduce their debt to $6.4 billion and the company expects to repurchase shares worth of $200 million in the current quarter.              The clearing and transaction fees, which contributed around 55% of ICE's overall revenues, recovered marginally this quarter after 6% decline in the prior quarter, due lack of investors' interest in trading under uncertain macro conditions and investors looking for safer investment option. The commodities and financial derivatives trading volumes continued their phenomenal growth trend, with around 11% growth for the quarter. The U.S. economy  has seen improvement in GDP and employment rates and the recently concluded U.S. presidential election has contributed to increased volatility as well, which led to lesser year-over-year decline in the equity options and cash equity trading volumes in comparison to the prior quarters. However, the consistent loss of market share in these product lines is a cause of concern for the company as it offsets the overall growth in transaction fees.Please refer to    the full Trefis analysis for Intercontinental   Exchange.

2017-02-03,CME Earnings: Surge In Trading Volumes And International Expansion Favor Growth,"Trading Revenues Benefit    ed From The U.S. Presidential Election And Improving   Market Conditions The trading volumes, which grew by a moderate 8% in the first three quarters, saw 24% surge in the fourth quarter. Among the various asset classes, interest rate derivatives were had the highest trading volumes, and grew the most during the quarter, driven by the Fed's interest rate hike in December. With a series of rate hikes expected in the year ahead and Fed's indication of year end rates in the range as large as 0.9%-2.1%, we expect the increased volatility to propel a significant growth in trading volumes.       Oil prices recovered after prolonged decline for over a year. This possibly drove the energy derivatives trading volumes. Since the outlook for the restricted production of oil remains uncertain, we expect the market volatility to continue in the near term, thus promoting the growth in trading volumes.       The investors' move to stick with safer investment options, amid unfavorable macro conditions, drove the demand for precious metals such as gold and silver, promoting the trading volumes for metals.Equity derivatives, which showed decline for most of the year, saw recovery in the last quarter under increased volatility from the improvement in U.S. macro conditions and the recently concluded presidential elections. With investors trying to assess the impact of Donald Trumps's election on various industries and accordingly take positions in the companies' stocks, we expect the trading volumes to sustain growth momentum in the near term.    As the company is looking forward to improvising on its existing risk management capabilities to help customers cope in times of distress, innovations to suit customer requirements and expanding its global footprint, we expect an even better year for the company. The company expects 5% business growth for the year ahead.See    the full Trefis analysis for CME Group.

2017-08-07,What Nasdaq's Acquisition Of Sybenetix Means,"Here’s a look at Nasdaq’s move to acquire Sybenetix against the backdrop of evolving regulations since 2008-09 and the rising integration of financial institutions with advanced technology.Regulations, Policies & RegTechThe web of regulations, polices and scrutiny in the financial markets has grown more complex since the 2008 financial crisis; Market Abuse Regulation (MAR), Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID II), and Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act are some of the regulations that have come into effect over these years. The evolving regulative landscape has led to ‘regulatory compliance’ becoming one of the major challenges for entities in capital markets.The growing scrutiny and fear of compliance failures (and fines), risk of reputational damage, and operational costs are giving way to a major structural and technological shift across the industry.One such trend is the emergence of regulatory technology, aka RegTech. Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) defines RegTech as a subset of FinTech, “covering new and emerging technologies that assist the financial services industry in meeting its regulatory compliance obligations, in a faster and more cost-effective manner.”Right from compliance monitoring, fraud detection and data management (including access, storage, and reporting) to identification and interpretation of regulation, the range of applications that can be tapped via RegTech is immense.The rise in RegTech is evident from the increasing number of startups and deal activity in the space: estimates suggest that a record 102 deals were recorded in 2016 with funding reaching $732 million. ‘Emergence of RegTech’ is among the top 10 trends in capital markets in 2017 as per a Capgemini report.Collaborations So FarNasdaq, the world's first electronic stock market, is home to approximately 3,900 total listings with a market value of approximately $12 trillion.Nasdaq’s risk and surveillance offerings already include SMARTS and TradeGuard; SMARTS powers surveillance and compliance for 47 marketplaces, 17 regulators and 140 market participants across 65 markets globally while TradeGuard is a comprehensive risk management suite. Australia-based SMARTS was acquired by Nasdaq back in 2010.Nasdaq has been a pioneer in using advanced technologies. It entered an alliance with Digital Reasoning offering industry-leading cognitive computing platform, Synthesys in 2016. The strategic tie-up was done with the intention to bring Digital Reasoning’s natural language processing and machine intelligence based technology to the data and detection capabilities delivered by SMARTS to offer more efficient surveillance solutions. Digital Reasoning’s Synthesys has delivered impressive results to institutions including UBS, Goldman Sachs, Point 72 and many others “with documented outcomes such as a 250% increase in detection acuity, 50% reduction in false positives, and a quadrupling in efficiency making it feasible to extend electronic communications surveillance to 100% of employees.”Now, Sybenetix is set to complement and reinforce Nasdaq’s surveillance offerings. “We believe behavioral science, cognitive computing and machine intelligence are essential to a successful, holistic surveillance offering and critical to efficient and effective organizational compliance with an increasingly intricate global regulatory environment. This acquisition accelerates our offering to the buy-side and advances our ambitions to expand market integrity controls into all segments of the capital markets,” Adena Friedman, President and CEO of Nasdaq, said.With Sybenetix, Nasdaq will be better equipped to resolve key surveillance challenges facing the asset management industry. The acquisition will thus help it to gain ground and establish itself in the asset management segment.While Nasdaq is leading the way, other exchanges (such as London Stock Exchange) and the regulatory authority FINRA are embracing advanced technologies. FINRA, which currently processes an average of 50 billion—and up to 75 billion—transactions every day is already using big data, cloud computing and analytics, and is expected to use AI in coming times.Such increase in technology savviness of stock exchanges will accelerate detection of market manipulation and compliance breaches. Overall, precision in finding any deviousness will boost client confidence, reduce penalties and costs, while smoothening conduct of operations.

2018-04-24,Can Discover Financial (DFS) Q1 Earnings Beat on Card Sales?,"Discover Financial Services  DFS  will release first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 26 after market close.      Discover Financial Services Price and EPS   Surprise                   Discover Financial Services Price and EPS   Surprise    |      Discover Financial Services Quote     Zacks Rank:  Discover Financial carries a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, a company needs to have a positive ESP to be confident about an earnings surprise. Hence, this combination leaves surprise prediction inconclusive.       We caution against Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.     Stocks to Consider      Here are some companies from the Finance sector that you may want to consider as these have the right combination of elements to deliver an earnings beat this time around:     Aflac Incorporated AFL  has an Earnings ESP of +1.73% and a Zacks Rank #2. The company is set to report first-quarter earnings on Apr 25. You can see  the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here  .      Nasdaq, Inc. NDAQ  has an Earnings ESP of +0.31% and a Zacks Rank of 3. The company is set to report first-quarter earnings on Apr 25.     ConnectOne Bancorp, Inc. CNOB  has an Earnings ESP of +2.86% and is a Zacks #3 Ranked player. The company is set to report first-quarter earnings on Apr 25.     Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?      Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics.

2018-04-25,"FOCUS-Shipping's Baltic Exchange turns to grains, gas and even air freight","By Jonathan SaulLONDON, April 25 (Reuters) - The Baltic Exchange, owned by Singapore Exchange, plans to launch new indexes for grains, gas and potentially air freight in its biggest shake-up for more than a decade, according to executives and two sources familiar with the matter.The London-run company operates the world's leading shipping freight index, which tracks rates for vessels transporting dry bulk commodities including iron ore and coal. It is looking to diversify its business after a near decade-long shipping downturn hit trading volumes and profitability.For its listed owner, the far larger Singapore Exchange (SGX), the new products are part of a drive to expand its own global presence and increase its market share, particularly in Asia.The centuries-old Baltic told Reuters it was developing two new grain freight indexes as well as a liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) index.The grain indexes, which the company aims to launch this year, will be tradable instruments, allowing investors to take a position on freight rates at a point in the future, known as forward freight agreements or FFAs.The new products will target users including gas and grains players, moving the company beyond its traditional shipping base, which it hopes will help counter future market shocks.Some of the biggest grains traders such as U.S. groups Cargill, Archer Daniels Midland, Bunge  and China'sCOFCO International have been consulted on the development of the new grains indexes, according to the two sources, who declined to be named, citing market sensitivity.Cargill, Bunge and ADM declined to comment. Alessio La Rosa, global head of freight with COFCO International, confirmed the group was involved in the initiative, adding that it expected the new indexes ""to be beneficial"".For SGX, which acquired the Baltic in 2016 for 87 million pounds ($121 million), the new indexes could boost its market share in FFA clearing volumes - currently estimated at about 50 percent - and fend off rival clearing houses such as U.S. exchange Nasdaq  and Europe's EEX, part of the Deutsche Boerse group.Mike Syn, head of derivatives at SGX, stressed that the Baltic needed to expand its global customer base. ""Profitability will result if we are able to get the world to accept that they need these tools,"" he said. STRATEGIC RISKSThe Baltic Exchange, which has been located in the heart of the City of London since its founding in a coffee house in 1744, produces daily benchmark rates and indexes that are used to trade and settle freight contracts. It also publishes data used in the multi-billion dollar freight derivatives market.It did not disclose how much the new products would cost to develop, launch and operate. But there are risks - the indexes may never take off, or could take years to gain traction or fail to provide significant returns.SGX, which has a market value of 8 billion Singapore dollars  ($6 billion), does not break out the Baltic's financial performance. The last annual report directly filed by the Baltic Exchange, for the year ending March 2016, showed its profit after tax more than halved to 968,570 pounds.The Baltic does not have any direct competitors at this stage. But with growing interest from investors in shipping this year, following an improvement in the market, the firm could face potential challengers from players like data provider S&P Global Platts or companies in China such as the Shanghai Shipping Exchange, according to industry sources. TAKING TO AIRThe Baltic Exchange is also exploring the possibility of moving into air freight in the future, to provide indexes for freight routes potentially in Europe, according to two sources familiar with the matter.CEO Jackson did not confirm this, saying the firm presently had ""nothing in the pipeline for air freight"", but he added: ""We are an established benchmark provider and if it has got the word freight in it we should be looking at it.""SGX's Syn added: ""For air freight as a concept, we would need to learn to get to know a new group of people and it would not be a stretch.""Before SGX's acquisition of the company, the Baltic was privately owned by shareholders, many of whom were in the shipping industry and included ship brokers, companies and individuals.""The shareholders (before the acquisition) did not want the Baltic to take any risks,"" Jackson said.""We are more reactive now, more willing to test things and take the risk of failure,"" he added. ""Our decisions are a lot  more commercial.""($1 = 0.7175 pounds; $1 = 1.3245 Singapore dollars) Dry bulk shipping looks to sector recovery (graphic)."

2018-05-04,Foes of market data fee hikes encouraged by SEC scrutiny,"By John McCrankNEW YORK, May 4 (Reuters) - A recent move by U.S. securities regulators demanding stock exchanges do a better job justifying price changes for public market data feeds could lead to more transparency around data costs, the head of one of the world's largest trading firms said on Friday.Wall Street firms and industry groups have complained for more than a decade, with little effect, that market data fees charged by stock exchanges are too high and that regulators rubber stamp the exchanges' data price increases.""When we started down this path a couple of years ago just questioning the need for market data increases, I certainly felt a little bit like Don Quixote, you know, tilting into the windmill,"" said Doug Cifu, chief executive officer of Virtu Financial.Market data contains key information on quotes and orders and is the lifeblood of the electronic marketplace.The data fees changes the SEC repealed are for public feeds for Nasdaq-  and New York Stock Exchange-listed securities. Those data feeds are essential for trading and brought in nearly $400 million in revenue last year for U.S. securities exchanges, which collectively govern them.While the fee changes would not have raised revenues for the exchanges overall, at least one firm could have seen a steep price increase, with the monthly cap on how much any single firm must pay for the essential data rising to $1,260,000, from $686,400.The exchanges said the change was needed because firms could merge, hit the monthly cap sooner, and pay less in fees.For context, in September, TD Ameritrade  bought Scottrade, combining two of the largest online brokerages, both of which use the data.The SEC said the exchanges did not give enough information on why they were making the fee changes, raising ""questions as to whether the changes will result in fees that are fair and reasonable, not unreasonably discriminatory,"" the SEC said.""The move is seen by many brokers and electronic market makers as an indication that the SEC is focused on reining in the data fees that exchanges collect from their customers,"" said Doug Clark, a managing director at brokerage Investment Technology Group, in a note to clients."
2017-04-27,Key Takeaways From NASDAQ's Q1 Earnings,"Non-Trading Businesses Continued Growth Due To Acquisitions, Proprietary Products NASDAQ's non-trading business lines generate around 63% of the company's overall revenues. These businesses grew by around 10% in the first quarter. The growth in the Information Services segment was supported by increased adoption of its in-house products such as IR Insights and Influencer and revenues from the acquisition of ISE. The Corporate Solutions segment grew primarily due to the revenue addition from the acquisition of Marketwired and Boardvantage. The Market Technology segment grew organically under increased uptake of software licensing and support, surveillance, and BWise advisory. Increased demand for data and technology-related products and services is likely to sustain the growth momentum for these segments.Market Services Has Grown Due To AcquisitionsThe company generates about  37% of its revenue from Market Services, and this segment has grown by 8% year on year. The growth due to acquisitions was partially offset by the decline in trading volumes resulting from unfavorable economic conditions and increased competition. The acquisition of NASDAQ CXC slightly managed to offset the huge losses due to a decline in cash equity trading volumes. The equity options volumes picked up pace, post the acquisition of ISE, which gave NASDAQ a massive 40% market share in the U.S. equity options market.Investors have possibly shifted to exchanges with a wider range of financial product offerings with more earning opportunities. Furthermore, the recent launch of Investors' Exchange is likely to be a threat for the company's equity business.Please refer to the full Trefis analysis for NasdaqView Interactive Institutional Research (Powered by Trefis):Global Large Cap | U.S. Mid & Small Cap | European Large & Mid Cap The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."

2018-05-21,The Largest Pot Stock in the World Is Moving to the NYSE,"In just over two weeks, the Canadian federal government will   be making a   game-changing decision    for the legal cannabis industry. Its Senate is set to vote on   bill C-45, which is more commonly known as the Cannabis Act.   Assuming a positive vote, the Cannabis Act, which would legalize   recreational marijuana throughout the country, is expected to be   quickly moved through the necessary steps to be signed into law.   By August or September, legal weed sales to adults aged 18 or   over are expected to commence.Opening the door to legal marijuana sales should allow the   Canadian pot industry to add approximately $5 billion in annual   sales, when ramped up. This will come atop the revenue already   being realized from medical cannabis sales and via exports to   medical marijuana-legal foreign countries.           Image source: Getty Images.However, Canada becoming the first developed country in the   world to legalize adult-use cannabis is far from the only ""   marijuana first    "" we've witnessed this year. In February, Canadian weed   investment company   Cronos Group    (NASDAQ: CRON) , which has three core assets, announced that it   was becoming the first Canadian pot stock to uplist to the   Nasdaq    (NASDAQ: NDAQ) . Moving from the over-the-counter (OTC) exchange   to a more reputable exchange like the Nasdaq allowed for improved   liquidity, as well as cleared the way for institutional investors   to take a position in Cronos Group. Wall Street traditionally   shies away from investing in OTC-listed companies.Now, another pot stock is following somewhat in its   footsteps. But this isn't just any old marijuana company -- it's   the largest pot stock in the world,   Canopy Growth Corp.    (NASDAQOTH: TWMJF) . Last week, Canopy Growth, which boasts a $5   billion market cap, announced its intent to list its stock under   the ticker symbol ""CGC"" on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE)   before the end of May.Why the NYSE and not the Nasdaq? According to CEO Bruce Linton   in an   interview with Bloomberg    , ""Ultimately one of them is on Wall Street and has a bit more   history and cache, and the neighbors on it are pretty substantive   companies."" In other words, the added history and credibility of   the NYSE was the swaying factor.Like Cronos Group, Canopy's listing will open the door to   institutional investment, as well as help bring legal cannabis   investing into the mainstream. ""One of the primary drivers of   this listing is, as we are expanding globally, having U.S.   institutional investors helps,"" said Linton. ""I think the   investment community has to drop the pot jokes and talk about the   investment grade opportunity.""Being listed on a reputable exchange also may create an   opportunity for Canopy Growth to one day join the prestigious   S&P 500    . To list, Canopy Growth would need to meet minimum liquidity   requirements, which shouldn't be difficult following its   uplisting and investor interest, as well as hit a market cap of   $6.1 billion. If Canada legalizes recreational cannabis as   expected, Canopy joining the S&P 500 becomes a genuine   possibility in the future.           Image source: Getty Images.Though Canopy Growth's uplisting may create an initial surge   in the company's share price, much like the way Cronos Group's   stock reacted following its debut on the Nasdaq in late February,   investors would be wise to look past this short-term driver and   pay attention to the longer-term catalysts and risks that matter.   When it comes to catalysts, few things are more important to   Canopy than its capacity expansion or its leading distribution   channels.According to the company, it now has 2.4 million square feet   of licensed growing capacity and appears to be on its way to   increasing that figure to 5.7 million square feet over time.   Though Canopy hasn't exactly laid out a timeline for when its   greenhouses are expected to be complete -- nor has it laid out   its annual production guidance -- it seems reasonable to expect   annual production to near or top 500,000 kilograms when at full   capacity.Mind you, this doesn't include any   purchase agreements    Canopy might have in place with smaller growers, such as   Sunniva    . With the exception of   Aurora Cannabis    , which would increase its annual capacity to 570,000 kilograms   if its acquisition of   MedReleaf     goes through, no other growers even come close to Canopy   Growth Corp.Also important are Canopy's multiple channels to sell its   cannabis. Canopy has the most recognizable weed brand in the   country in Tweed, the means to move product on its website, and   also will have brick-and-mortar outlets to sell cannabis. In   addition, it has a growing number of international arrangements   to export marijuana to medically legal countries. As icing on the   cake, spirits giant   Constellation Brands     is a   minority stakeholder    that can provide marketing expertise and product   partnerships.           Image source: Getty Images.On the downside, Canopy Growth's heavy investment in capacity   expansion could mean that this company won't produce a meaningful   per-share profit for years. Even with economies of scale working   in its favor and revenue set to rise by a triple-digit percentage   in 2018 and 2019, profitability could elude Canopy as it socks   every ounce of operating cash flow into capacity expansion and   its distribution channels.Also of worry is the possibility of a   domestic marijuana glut in Canada    . Various reports suggest that domestic demand for marijuana in   Canada will come in around 800,000 kilograms a year. However,   fully funded capacity for the dozens of licensed producers   suggests that annual yield could easily top 2 million kilograms   by 2020 or 2021.What happens to this more than 1 million kilograms in excess   capacity? Presumably it gets exported to foreign countries where   medical marijuana is legal.Unfortunately, with no real precedent to a legalization of   this magnitude, no one really knows whether these foreign   countries will be able to absorb so much excess weed. In other   words, if a supply glut becomes reality, Canopy's margins, and   that of the entire industry, could take a hit.For the time being, Canopy Growth's shareholders can briefly   celebrate the company's expected uplisting to the NYSE, but   they'd be wise to keep their eyes on the horizon.          10 stocks we like better than Canopy Growth     Corporation            When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Whereas the broad-based   S&P 500    nearly tripled its historic average and gained 20% in 2017, the   aggregate increase in market cap for all virtual currencies made   the S&P 500's move look like a flat line. Since the beginning   of 2017, the combined market cap of digital currencies has soared   by as much as 4,500%, which would have taken the stock market   decades to deliver.Leading that charge is bitcoin, the world's most popular and   valuable cryptocurrency by market cap. It also happens to be the   virtual token that merchants around the globe are most likely to   accept, and it's largely responsible for bringing   blockchain technology    into the mainstream.           Image source: Getty Images.Bitcoin's first-to-market advantages, along with its regular   media coverage, make it a popular investment vehicle for those   people who fear missing out on big gains. After all, $1,000   invested in bitcoin in March 2010 would be worth around $3.9   billion today.However, buying bitcoin has often meant opening an account and   trading on a decentralized exchange. Sure, there are a number of   larger, more reputable exchanges, such as Coinbase. Still, since   cryptocurrencies aren't regulated or backed in the traditional   sense as, say, the U.S. dollar, these exchanges are off-limits   for most institutional investors and perhaps even the average   retail investor. That's why a handful of trading platforms have   been pushing hard to introduce new bitcoin-based products that'll   open the door to institutional and retail investors in a more   regulated setting.For example, both   CBOE Global Markets    (NASDAQ: CBOE) and   CME Group    (NASDAQ: CME) began listing bitcoin futures on their trading   platforms back in December. A number of major brokerage firms   have also expanded their futures trading capacity to allow their   customers access to either the CBOE's or CME's platform.   Nasdaq    (NASDAQ: NDAQ) has also noted that it plans to launch bitcoin   futures trading sometime in the second quarter.But why stop there? While futures trading opened an avenue for   institutional investors to get their foot in the door with   bitcoin, it's still pretty tough for the average investor to do   so. You see, these contracts cover either one or five bitcoins,   meaning they can cost anywhere from $11,700 to $58,500 at the   moment. Most retail investors aren't going to place such a big   bet on a still illiquid market.           Image source: Getty Images.Instead, trading platforms like the NYSE and CBOE have been   itching to bring a retail-friendly product to market:   bitcoin exchange-traded funds    (ETFs). A bitcoin ETF wouldn't track the actual price of bitcoin,   per se. Instead, it would be tied to the bitcoin futures price   and, with the exception of expense fees, largely mimic the   movement of futures contracts. More than a dozen bitcoin ETFs   have been proposed in recent weeks, including those that would   allow for bearish bets against bitcoin, as well as leveraged   bitcoin ETFs that would double the daily return (or loss) for   investors.While these would more than likely be high-demand financial   products, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) isn't   having any of it -- at least not yet.Two weeks ago, Dalia Blass, the SEC's director of the division   of investment management, detailed a multiplicity of concerns   about proposed bitcoin funds in a letter to two trade groups who   represent fund managers. In particular, the SEC demanded answers   to at least   31 questions    regarding how mutual funds or ETFs planned to store, safeguard,   and price the asset. ""There are a number of significant investor   protection issues that need to be examined before sponsors begin   offering these funds to investors,"" Blass said.           Image source: Getty Images.Remember, even though bitcoin is decentralized, which is   supposed to remove the chance that a cyberattack will cripple the   network, crypto theft   has been somewhat common    . Around 850,000 bitcoin tokens (worth close to $10 billion   today) were stolen from Mt. Gox a few years ago. Mt. Gox had   handled a majority of bitcoin transactions before the alleged   hack and went bankrupt from it as a result. More recently, in   December 2017, NiceHash fell victim to a $70 million bitcoin   theft thanks to hackers.  Safeguarding bitcoin is no simple   task.Another issue is that bitcoin futures listing hasn't exactly   stabilized the market. Intraday double-digit percentage swings   have become commonplace since the beginning of December. The real   issue is that institutional investors   haven't jumped in as expected    . Even though most institutions believe bitcoin is primed to   drop, few if any have the nerve to put any sizable amount of   money on a bet against bitcoin through futures trading. That   means highly emotional retail investors are still predominantly   driving the price (and volatility) of bitcoin.Long story short, don't expect bitcoin ETFs to be hitting the   market anytime soon.

2018-07-04,CME Group Q2 ADV Rises as Volumes in 5 Product Lines Improve,"CME Group Inc  .  CME  has reported volumes for the second quarter of 2018, marking double-digit growth across five product lines. ADV of 18.4 million contracts per day improved 12% year over year. Of this, Options volume contracted 2% year over year to average 3.5 million contracts while electronic options expanded 28% year over year with an average of 0.3 million contracts.          Metals volume of 0.7 million contracts per day rose 27% whereas Interest rate volume of 9.2 million contracts grew 12% and Foreign exchange volume ascended 18% to about 1 million. Agricultural volume of about 1.7 million contracts climbed 16% year over year while Equity index volume of 3.1 million increased 14%. Only Energy volume of 2.6 million contracts was flat year over year.     High volumes in the second quarter were driven by better numbers in each month. ADV for June gained 8% to 17.8 million contracts per day, led by an increase in ADV across five of its six product lines.     Recently, securities exchange MarketAxess Holdings Ltd. MKTX  reported a trading volume of $147.8 billion for June.     CME Group is scheduled to report second-quarter 2018 results before market open on Jul 26. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company's bottom line is pegged at $1.68 on revenues of $1.03 billion, reflecting a 36.6% surge and an 11.3% year-over-year growth, respectively.     Our proven model shows that the company is likely to deliver a positive earnings surprise with the right combination of a favorable Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and an Earnings ESP  of +2.08%.     Improved volumes across trading line should continue to fuel volume growth for CME Group. Increasing electronic trading volume adds scalability and hence leverage to the operating model. Expansion of futures products in the emerging markets plus a rise in non-transaction related opportunities as well as OTC (over the counter) offerings should continue to contribute modestly to top-line growth in the years ahead. Efforts to expand and cross-sell via strategic alliances, judicious acquisitions, product launches as well as a widening global footprint should also drive growth.     Stocks to Consider      Some better-ranked stocks from the same space are Intercontinental Exchange Inc. ICE  and Nasdaq Inc. NDAQ  , both carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see    the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy)   stocks here   .     Intercontinental Exchange operates regulated exchanges, clearing houses and listings venues for financial and commodity markets in the United States, the United Kingdom, Continental Europe, Asia, Israel and Canada. The company came up with an average four-quarter beat of 1.27%.     Nasdaq provides trading, clearing, marketplace technology, regulatory, securities listing, information and public as well as private company services worldwide. The company delivered an average four-quarter beat of 4.80%.     Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest Strategies      It's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +21.9% in 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +115.0%, +109.3%, +104.9%, +98.6%, and +67.1%.     And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon. Over the years it has been remarkably consistent. From 2000 - 2017, the composite yearly average gain for these strategies has beaten the market more than 19X over. Maybe even more remarkable is the fact that we're willing to share their latest stocks with you without cost or obligation.

2017-12-08,Bitcoin Tumbles From Frenzied Run; JPMorgan's Dimon Still 'Highly Skeptical',"Another day, another frantic turn for Bitcoin. The   cryptocurrency had slid 8%, after   punching past $17,000 a day earlier    , and at least the second major financial official in recent   months likened the cryptocurrency to the tulip bulb bubble of the   1600s.[ibd-display-video id=2544553 width=50 float=left   autostart=true] Bitcoin's value stood at $ 15,441.94 late Fri day   afternoon, according to      CoinDesk    , after tumbling to $13,963.53 overnight. Bitcoin only topped   $12,000 for the first time on Tuesday night.The mouth-foaming rise and fall in the currency's price comes   two days ahead of the planned   Cboe    (   CBOE    ) launch of Bitcoin futures. CBOE will have a jump on   CME Group    (   CME    ), which will start trading on Dec. 18.   Nasdaq    (   NDAQ    ) plans to offer similar futures next year.Meanwhile, Stefan Ingves, a governor of Sweden's central   bank and a chairman of global regulators at the Basel Committee -   a group that tries to establish global banking standards - became   the latest financial official to urge caution over Bitcoin.He told   CNBC    that it was wrong to call Bitcoin a cryptocurrency, saying that   it was ""It's kind of a crypto-asset, but definitely not a   cryptocurrency.""

""If you look at what has happened in the past, when it comes   to those types of hypes, being it tulip bulbs or a bunch of other   things over the centuries,"" he said, ""the odds are against those   who actually think that this is going to be the future.""Those remarks echoed similar ones from   JPMorgan Chase    (   JPM    ) CEO Jamie Dimon, who in September said that Bitcoin was ""worse   than tulip bulbs,"" referring to the speculative craze in Holland   in the 1630s that sent the prices of the most exotic tulip bulbs   to stratospheric heights, only to have those prices crash a few   years later.JPMorgan's Dimon said Friday that he's still ""highly   skeptical"" of Bitcoin.   Goldman Sachs    (   GS    ) CEO Lloyd Blankfein said that something that flails as wildly   as Bitcoin ""   doesn't feel like a currency, doesn't feel like a   store of value.    ""Goldman Sachs has said it will clear Bitcoin futures trades   for clients, but JPMorgan Chase and   Citigroup    (C) won't right away, the   Financial   Times    reported.Bitcoin's epic price surge has come as big and small investors   alike try to grab hold of the cryptocurrency. According to   Autonomous Research, there are already 171 crypto-focused hedge   funds.Offering Bitcoin futures contracts could clear the way for   Bitcoin exchange traded funds. The futures will allow more people   to take long and short positions and hedge their bets on the   cryptocurrency without owning it directly.

If you've even held a decade, that is considered a long-term shareholder.He held through the super bear market of the 1970s, the 1980s-90s mega-bull and then the recent Great Recession sell off. That takes a lot of guts.   Luck or Skill? Mr. Gremel's story is a feel-good story because the investment turned out well. Walgreens is still in business all these years later, when many of its peers are not.Additionally, according to YahooFinance, the stock is up over 8,000% since 1985.Was Mr. Gremel a good investor, or did he just get lucky when he chose Walgreens?Luck does play a part in investing, of course. But for every Walgreens there is a Montgomery Wards. That's why you should keep a diverse portfolio. Holding onto just one stock for 70 years would be considered a risky strategy.

She also sought EPS growth of at least 10% and a dividend over 1%.Dividends are a key component to buy and hold because, if they're re-invested, they compound.1. Tyson Foods  (NYSE:  TSN  - Free Report  ) is one of the largest beef, pork and poultry producers in America. It trades with a forward P/E of just 12.2 and is expected to grow earnings by 14% this year.2. Thor Industries  (NYSE:  THO  - Free Report  ) just had a record third quarter as RV sales were up 56.9%. Earnings are expected to jump 33% this year.3. Nasdaq  (NASDAQ:  NDAQ  - Free Report  ) just increased its quarterly dividend by 19%. It yields 1.8%. Earnings are expected to rise 11.8% in 2017.4. MetLife  (NYSE:  MET  - Free Report  ) was founded in 1868 yet it's still expected to grow earnings by 16.5% this year. It's cheap, with a forward P/E of just 9.9 and it pays a dividend yielding 3%.5. Celanese  (NYSE:  CE  - Free Report  ) is over 100 years old but is expected to grow earnings by 10.5% this year.

2016-09-20,How Are Silver And Copper Prices Impacting CME's Metal Trading Volumes?,"How Have Silver Prices Trended? Industrial demand for silver has declined slightly over the past year as a result of a decline in semiconductor sales, and investment demand for the metal has been volatile. The winding down of the Federal Reserve's Quantitative Easing (QE) program in 2014 dampened the safe haven demand for silver, pressuring prices. However, prices have rebounded sharply this year amid heightened macroeconomic uncertainty and subdued economic growth.       How Have Copper Prices Fared? Demand for copper is correlated with industrial growth, and consequently economic growth. China is the world's largest consumer of copper, accounting for over 40% of the global consumption of the metal. A slowdown in Chinese economic growth over the past few years has negatively impacted Chinese imports of copper, and consequently global demand for the metal. As a result of weak demand conditions, copper prices have declined over the course of 2014 and 2015 and are expected to decline further in 2016.       How Has CME Benefited? CME has largely benefited from the volatility in silver and copper prices over the past few years, with trading volumes for the metals increasing by more than 38% over the previous two year period. Continued macroeconomic uncertainty is likely to continue driving near-term demand for silver as a safe haven asset, as well as copper demand in China. These factors are likely to drive metals trading volumes in the coming quarters.See    the full Trefis analysis for CME Group.

2017-12-12,"SEC Has This Advice For Investors In Bitcoin, Other Cryptocurrencies","Wall Street's top cop offered investing advice, with a strong   dose of caution, on cryptocurrencies as Bitcoin continues to soar   and more voices warn of a   bubble    .[ibd-display-video id=3017249 width=50 float=left   autostart=true] A   statement    from SEC Chairman Jay Clayton came a day after    Cboe Global Markets    (   CBOE    ) launched Bitcoin futures trading on Sunday, with   CME Group    (   CME    ) and   Nasdaq    (   NDAQ    ) set to follow Dec. 18.The SEC is now addressing concerns that cryptocurrencies and   initial coin offerings (ICOs) offer ""substantially less investor   protection than in our traditional securities markets, with   correspondingly greater opportunities for fraud and   manipulation.""According to Clayton, investors should:Bitcoin was up nearly 3% Tuesday at $17,188.90, according   to      Coindesk    , while the one-month futures contract on Cboe was down 2%   at $18.180. Among Bitcoin-related stocks,   Riot Blockchain    (   RIOT    ) jumped 22% on the      stock market today    ,   Marathon Patent Group    (   MARA    ) fell 8%, and   Bitcoin Investment Trust    (GBTC) shot up 23%.     IBD'S TAKE:      Are Bitcoin, Ethereum and other digital currencies a     speculator's game? Individual investors should be extremely     cautious about diving into this new area. Read this feature     about     Bitcoin risks       and potential gains.   On Monday, UBS chief global economist Paul Donovan issued a   warning on   cryptocurrencies.   He warned investors: ""Cryptocurrencies only have value if   accepted as currencies. However, they cannot be used for the most   important transaction in an economy, and cryptocurrency supply   can only rise and never fall (making them a poor store of value).

2018-03-15,The World's Largest Marijuana Stock Is Heading to the Nasdaq,"In case you've missed it, the marijuana industry is budding   before our eyes. In North America, according to cannabis research   firm ArcView, the legal weed industry is expected to reach nearly   $25 billion in annual sales by 2021. That works out to a compound   annual growth rate of 28% between now and then, placing it among   the fastest-growing industries on the planet.The public's perception toward pot also continues to shift.   What had once been a taboo drug that no politician would dare   discuss is now a topic covered in most U.S. elections, and even   discussed within American households.   Numerous polls    over the past year have found overwhelming support for the   legalization of recreational and medicinal marijuana.           Image source: Getty Images.Of course, no country has led the charge for pot progressivism   more than Canada. With the United States proving unwavering on   its Schedule I classification of cannabis, Canada has stepped   forward to become the industry's outlet. With legislation   currently being reviewed in parliament, Canada appears set to   become the first developed country in the world, and second   overall behind Uruguay, to have legalized recreational marijuana   by this summer. With a tax-deal in place with all but one   province (Manitoba), legalization simply seems like a formality   at this point.With the expectation of a surge in demand and sales --   adult-use weed could lead to $5 billion or more in added annual   sales in Canada -- Canada's largest growers have been busy   ramping up their production capacity. Perhaps none brings more to   the table than   Canopy Growth Corp.    (NASDAQOTH: TWMJF) , the largest marijuana company in the world,   by market cap.According to Canopy's recently released third-quarter   operating results, it has seven licensed facilities across   665,000 square feet of growing capacity, and it's constructing or   developing greenhouses on another   3.7 million square feet    in British Columbia. Though the company has been   tight-lipped about its production potential or greenhouse   completion dates, if we were to conservatively estimate 100,000   kilograms of production per 1 million square feet, Canopy Growth   could potentially deliver up to 400,000 kilograms annually within   a few years. By the turn of the decade, at least 300,000   kilograms in annual production looks like a near-certainty,   making it the clear leader in market share.As an avid acquirer and a master of building its cannabis   brands -- Tweed is the best-known weed brand throughout Canada --   investors have simply been waiting to see what Canopy and its   management team would do next. This past week, they got their   answer: Canopy Growth is heading to the   Nasdaq    (NASDAQ: NDAQ) .           Image source: Nasdaq.According to a        Reuters report       , Canopy Growth Corp. plans to list on the Nasdaq exchange in the   U.S. ""in due course,"" per CEO Bruce Linton. Canopy had been   preparing to be the first Canadian grower to list on the Nasdaq   in October, but its plans were halted when spirits giant   Constellation Brands    acquired a 9.9% stake    in the company for roughly $190 million, according to a speech   Linton gave at the Economic Club of Canada. Said Linton:When Constellation put money into our business, the number     of U.S. institutional investors interested in us went way up.     The Nasdaq is doing a great job not allowing people to list who     break federal laws and that's a place where we should list in     due course.When might this move happen? That's unclear at this time, but   Beacon Securities research analyst Vahan Ajamian suspects it   might occur during the second quarter. A Nasdaq listing would   open the floodgates for institutional investors to buy into the   company. Remember, quite a few institutional investors won't buy   stocks that trade on the over-the-counter (OTC) exchanges, which   is where Canopy Growth is currently listed.However, when it does make the move, Canopy won't be the first   to have done so. In the waning days of February,   Cronos Group    (NASDAQ: CRON)    beat it to the punch    . Interestingly enough, shares of Cronos Group soared as much as   36% in the week following its uplisting from the OTC exchange to   the Nasdaq exchange. This increase was likely a result of   institutional interest in Cronos as well as improved liquidity   and visibility. But with Canopy being the largest pot stock by   market cap, its interest from institutions and investors could   dwarf what happened to Cronos.           Image source: Getty Images.While a Nasdaq listing could bring a short-term lift to   Canopy's share price, it's not exactly a long-term driver of   value. Investors who are in the cannabis trade for the long haul   should be far more concerned about what the supply and demand   breakdown will look like come 2019 or 2020.As noted, Canopy Growth looks to be the largest cannabis   producer, with the top five producers generating anywhere from   900,000 kilograms to 1,000,000 kilograms in annual yield. The   problem is that Canada's annual demand may only tally around   800,000 kilograms, based on various reports and estimates.   Foreign markets where exporting is allowed could help absorb   domestic excess, but it's unclear at this point if demand will be   off the charts, of if a   marijuana glut    will hit the marketplace and drive per-gram prices significantly   lower.If there is a plus side here, it's that Canopy is well funded,   and its greenhouses are expected to see growing costs fall over   time. Thus, even with a substantial drop in per-gram cannabis   prices, Canopy should be fine. Not to mention, it's also focusing   more on extracts and cannabis oils than ever before, which are   higher-priced and higher-margin items. Still, the supply and   demand situation bears close monitoring.          10 stocks we like better than Canopy Growth     Corporation            When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

2017-07-26,"Nasdaq (NDAQ) Beats on Q2 Earnings, Tightens Expense View","Nasdaq, Inc  . NDAQ  reported second-quarter 2017 adjusted earnings per share of $1.02, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 96 cents. Also, the bottom line improved 12.1% year over year.      Nasdaq, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise                   Nasdaq, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS   Surprise    |      Nasdaq, Inc. Quote   On a GAAP basis, the company's net income skyrocketed 93% year over year to 87 cents per share.     Performance in Detail      Nasdaq's revenues of record $602 million increased 7% year over year. Revenues beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $595.3 million, which  was primarily due to a $34 million positive impact from acquisitions and organic growth of $15 million.     Adjusted operating expenses were $315 million in the reported quarter, up 5% year over year. This was mainly due to higher operating expenses related to the acquisitions closed in 2016. As of Jun 30, 2017, Nasdaq achieved $60 million in annualized run-rate cost synergies. Besides, the company estimated $10-$20 million in additional synergies to be realized post completion of other platform consolidations.     Notably, the company tightened the upper end of its 2017 non-GAAP operating expense to the range of $1.26-$1.29 billion from $1.26-$1.30 billion guided earlier.     Segment wise, net revenue at Market Services  jumped 14.4% from the year-ago quarter to $222 million. The upside was driven by higher revenues from the ISE and higher European cash equities revenues.     Revenues at Corporate Services  increased 1.2% year over year to $164 million. This was mainly due to the inclusion of revenues from Boardvantage acquisitions.     Information Services revenues  rose 7.5% year over year to $144 million. Higher proprietary data products revenues and higher assets under management in exchange traded products linked to Nasdaq indexes, drove the upside.     Revenues at Market Technology  increased 4.3% year over year to $72 million due to organic revenue growth. Market Technology order intake totaled $64 million. The Nasdaq Stock Market witnessed 64 new listings during the first quarter, 36 of which were IPOs.     Financial Update      Nasdaq had cash and cash equivalents of $374 million as of Jun 30, 2017, down 10.5% from 2016-end level. As of Jun 30, 2017, debt decreased 15.1% over 2016-end level to $3.1 billion.     Dividend and Share Repurchase Update      The board of directors approved of a 38 cents per share quarterly dividend, which will be paid on Sep29, 2017 to shareholders of record on Sep 15, 2017.     The company had about $273 million remaining under its buyback authorization.     Our Take      Nasdaq's results reflect a decent performance. Growth looks encouraging as the company remains focused on expansion through acquisitions and organic initiatives that enable entry and open up cross-selling opportunities into new markets. The top line should also benefit from the company's consistent focus on its strategy to accelerate non-transaction revenue base, including technology, listing and information revenues. However, higher expenses and stiff competition remain key concerns.     Nasdaq carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

2018-04-11,7 Reasons Why Nasdaq (NDAQ) Holds Promise for Investors,"Estimates for Nasdaq, Inc  . NDAQ  have been revised upward over the past 7 days, reflecting analysts' confidence in the stock, ahead of its first-quarter earnings. The stock has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 and 2019 earnings being raised 0.4% and 0.2% to $4.84 and $5.31, respectively.   Shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) securities exchange have rallied 12.4% year to date, outperforming the industry  's growth of 4.3%.        Let's focus on the factors making Nasdaq a stock to hold on to for greater returns.     Improving Top Line  : Last few years saw the top line rise at Nasdaq, witnessing a two-year CAGR of nearly 8%, owing to both organic and inorganic strategic expansions.     Compelling Inorganic Growth Story  : Strategic buyouts helped Nasdaq expedite growth profile, expand its technology offering, gain direct access to the Canadian equities market and fortify its Corporate Solutions business. Acquisitions continue to enhance the company's capabilities and have already been accretive to operational results.     Growth Initiatives  : Nasdaq deepened its focus on Market Technology and Information Services businesses, offering biggest growth opportunities per the company's developmental strategies. The company also sets sights on its core special marketplace platform businesses. However, it intends to lower capital resources for investment in business that fails to offer considerable growth for Nasdaq.     Nasdaq's organic growth has been aided by its strategy to accelerate its non-transaction revenue base, including market technology, listing and information revenues plus management's medium-term outlook, calling for mid-single digit growth over the next three to five years.     Intelligent Capital Management  : Nasdaq boasts a healthy balance sheet and cash position along with modest operating cash flow from its diverse business model. Banking on this strength, the board of directors has recently hiked its quarterly dividend by 16%. While the raise marks four-year CAGR of 35.6%, the company has a $500 million share buyback authorization. Its dividend yield betters the industry average, making the stock an attractive pick for yield-seeking investors.     Growth Projections  : The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings per share is pegged at $8.41, representing a year-over-year increase of 19.2% on 4.9% higher revenues of $2.6 billion.     For 2019, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings per share stands at $5.31 on $2.6 billion revenues, translating into a respective 9.7% and 3.1% year-over-year increase.     Nasdaq has expected long-term earnings per share growth of 9.7%.     Underpriced  : Looking at the company's price-to-book ratio - the best multiple for valuing securities exchanges because of large variations in their earnings results from one quarter to the next - shares are underpriced at the current level. The company has a trailing 12-month P/B ratio of 2.43, falling below the industry average of 2.76.     Positive Earnings Surprise History  : The company flaunts an encouraging earnings surprise history, having outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing five quarters with an average beat of 3.99%. This trend of consecutive estimate beats indicates the company's operational excellence.     In fact, our proven model states that the company is poised for an earnings beat in the to-be-reported quarter. This is because the stock has the right combination of the following two key ingredients for a positive earnings surprise, a favorable Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), which increases the predictive power of ESP and an  Earnings ESP  of +1.06% to be confident about an estimate beat.     Stocks to Consider      Some better-ranked stocks from the finance sector are CME Group Inc. CME  , CNA Financial Corporation. CNA  and AllianceBernstein Holding L.P.

2017-12-07,CBOE Bitcoin Futures: How Will They Work and Can I Invest With Them?,"Bitcoin has been the   surprise big winner of 2017    , with prices having soared higher as the cryptocurrency gains   credibility among a broader set of users as a store of value. One   thing that's prompted the latest rise for bitcoin is the rollout   of bitcoin   futures contracts    , which   CBOE Global Markets    (NASDAQ: CBOE) plans to open for trading on Dec. 10. Other   providers, including   CME Group    (NASDAQ: CME) and   Nasdaq OMX Group    (NASDAQ: NDAQ) , are also considering bitcoin futures rollouts,   with CME hoping for a Dec. 18 launch. But with CBOE looking like   it will be first to cross the finish line, would-be bitcoin   investors want to know what CBOE bitcoin futures will look like   and whether they can use the futures contracts to take positions   in the cryptocurrency. Here are the answers you need.The CBOE intends to launch bitcoin futures trading at 5 p.m.   CST on Sunday, Dec. 10. It might seem strange to ordinary stock   investors for a product to start trading on a Sunday afternoon,   but the launch time accounts for the time difference between U.S.   and Asian markets, allowing investors in Japan, China, and other   Asia-Pacific countries to start using the futures contracts when   they open for business Monday morning.The current contract specifications call for each CBOE bitcoin   futures contract to cover a single bitcoin. That would have   seemed like a small amount just a few months ago, but with prices   having soared past the $10,000 mark, the decision seems smarter   now.           Image source: Getty Images.CBOE intends to list many different expirations of futures   contracts for trading, including up to four weekly contracts a   month into the future, three near-term monthly contracts up to   three months into the future, and quarterly contracts at   three-month intervals in March, June, September, and   December.The CBOE's futures contracts will be cash-settled, which means   that no bitcoin will change hands. The final settlement value   will be equal to the official auction price for bitcoin as   determined by the Gemini Exchange, rounded to the nearest $0.01.   In practical terms, what that means is that if the price of   bitcoin goes up between the time you buy a futures contract and   its final settlement, you'll receive cash equal to the rise in   value. If it goes down, then you'll lose that amount of cash.Futures contracts require investors to put up an amount of   money equal to a set percentage of the value of the underlying   commodity as security for adverse price moves. This figure is   known as   margin    . CBOE intends to set an initial margin requirement of 30% for   bitcoin futures, but that number will be subject to change   depending on contract price volatility once the futures contracts   start trading.Most futures contracts have limits on how much underlying   prices can move within certain periods of time, and one major   concern for bitcoin investors has been the volatility of its   price. The CBOE has said that trading will halt for a 2-minute   period if the contract price moves more than 10% in either   direction from the previous day's settlement price. A 5-minute   halt will apply in the event of a 20% move. These circuit   breakers are shorter than what   stock exchanges have imposed for large moves    in major stock market benchmarks, reflecting the greater   volatility of the bitcoin market.Regular trading hours will be from 8:30 a.m. to 3:15 p.m. CST   Monday through Friday. Extended hours on weekdays run from 3:30   p.m. to 8:30 a.m. as well as from 5 p.m. Sunday afternoon through   8:30 a.m. on Monday morning. This will offer nearly continuous   trading over a five-day workweek, with just a daily 15 minute   break from Sunday at 5 p.m. to Friday at 3:15 p.m. CBOE bitcoin   futures won't trade from Friday afternoon through Sunday   afternoon.In order to buy or sell bitcoin futures contracts, you'll need   to have a futures account with your broker. Brokers will make   their own individual decisions about whether to allow customers   to trade bitcoin futures, so you should check with your broker   upfront to make sure that you'll be able to trade. Moreover,   brokers can impose their own margin requirements above and beyond   what the CBOE itself requires, so you'll want to ask questions   about your broker's own policies when you consider using bitcoin   futures.CBOE is offering a promotional deal under which it will waive   all of its transaction fees on bitcoin futures for the month of   December. However, investors will still have to check with their   futures brokers to learn about the commissions that they'll   charge to trade bitcoin futures. After December, the CBOE fee   schedule lists transaction fees of $0.25 to $0.50 per contract   side, which brokers can choose to pass through to customers or   incorporate into their own commission schedules.Introducing futures contracts will bring bitcoin to a new   level in the investing world. Futures will open the door to   trading for those who don't want to deal with the challenges of   owning actual bitcoin directly and who haven't been comfortable   with various exchange-traded products that purport to offer   bitcoin exposure. Moreover, it will offer a way for investors to   bet   against    bitcoin's further price advance.Not everyone is happy with the launch of bitcoin futures. Some   financial institutions have argued that bitcoin futures pose a   systemic risk, and they've asked the Commodity Futures Trading   Commission not to let the CBOE and its peers begin offering   futures contracts as currently proposed.Notwithstanding objections from third parties, it's likely   that CBOE bitcoin futures will launch as planned on Dec. 10. From   there, those who follow bitcoin will watch closely to see how   initial trading goes and what   clues to the cryptocurrency's future    they can glean from the way that buyers and sellers trade the new   contracts.

2018-04-27,Nasdaq asks regulators to let companies decide where they trade,"By John McCrankNEW YORK, April 27 (Reuters) - Nasdaq Inc  has asked regulators to allow it to give small companies a choice of trading on a single U.S. stock exchange, rather than all 13 of them, in an effort to make it easier for buyers and sellers of the stocks to find each other.Currently, regardless of where a stock is listed, it can be traded across exchanges. While that fragmented model works well for high-volume stocks, promoting competition and price discovery, it does not have the same effect on less liquid stocks, which become harder to trade, Nasdaq said.In October, the U.S. Treasury Department endorsed the idea of letting companies decide how many stock exchanges their shares trade on as part of a broader regulatory review.But the president of Nasdaq rival Cboe Global Markets Inc  cautioned last week at an SEC roundtable that giving exchanges a monopoly on trading certain stocks could lead to higher market data and exchange connectivity fees, due to the absence of competition. The move could also create a single point of failure. Currently, if a glitch at one stock exchange prevents trading in certain stocks, those stocks can still trade on other exchanges, as happened on the NYSE on Wednesday in stocks including Amazon.com Inc  and Google parent Alphabet Inc.On the positive side, the change would potentially reduce complexity and increase market stability efficiency, while making it easier for brokers to ensure they are getting the best prices for their clients.Under Nasdaq's proposal, the new rule would apply to companies with an initial market capitalization of less than $700 million, or with a continued market capitalization of $2 billion or less; have an initial average daily trading volume of 100,000 shares or less; and have a bid price greater than $1.There are 789 Nasdaq-listed companies with less than $700 million in market capitalization that would qualify based on trading volume and share price, Nasdaq said.The move would make it easier for the exchange to offer new financial incentives or market models, such as periodic auctions, for those names, which could encourage more trading, it added.

2017-10-26,CME Group (CME) Q3 Earnings Beat on Higher Trading Volumes,"CME Group Inc  . CME  reported third-quarter 2017 adjusted earnings per share of $1.19, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.16. The bottom line also improved 13.3% year over year.      CME Group Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise                           CME Group Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS   Surprise    |      CME Group Inc. Quote   Including one-time items, the net income was 91 cents per share, down 34.5% year over year.     Performance in Detail      CME Group's revenues of $891 million increased 5.8% year over year. This reported figure marginally beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $890 million. Improvement in revenues may be attributable to higher clearing and transaction fees (up 7% year over year), plus access and communication fees (up nearly 8%).     Total expenses increased 2.1% year over year to $322.9 million during the reported quarter, attributable to a rise in compensation and benefits, technology support services as well as licensing and other fee agreements.     Operating income improved about 8.1% to $567.9 million from the prior-year quarter.     Average daily volume (ADV) rose 10% year over year to a record 15.7 million contracts with growth across five of the six product lines. Average rate per contract increased in only one of the six product lines.     Financial Update      As of Sep 30, 2017, CME Group had $1.7 billion of cash and marketable securities, down 10% from the year-end 2016. As of Sep 30, 2017, long-term debt of $2.2 billion inched up 0.1% from  year-end 2016 figure.     As of Sep 30, 2017, the company had total assets worth $78.3 billion, up from $69.4 billion at year-end 2016.     The company paid dividends worth $224 million in the reported quarter.     Our Take      CME Group's results reflect a solid performance. The company remains well-positioned for growth, given its strong market position with diverse derivative product lines. Efforts to expand and cross-sell core exchange-traded business through strategic alliances and acquisitions, new product initiatives and global reach, boost growth. However, escalating costs and stiff competition remain key challenges.     Currently, CME Group carries a Zacks Rank # 3 (Hold).

MCO  - assigned Baa1 ratings to CBOE Holdings' $1.0 billion term loan credit agreement and $650 million 3.65% senior notes scheduled to mature in 2027 with a stable outlook.     According to Moody's, the company had borrowed $1.65 billion to fund the cash portion of the $3.4 billion transaction and to refinance Bats Global's existing debt.     Notably, this is the first time CBOE Holdings had debt in its balance sheet. However, the company hinted at plans to de-lever its balance sheet following the closure of the takeover. Hence, Moody's believes that the buyout will help CBOE Holdings to improve its debt leverage and interest coverage ratios. The rating agency, however, remains wary of the risks involved in the acquisition integration process. Nonetheless, the stable outcome reflects Moody's anticipation of smooth integration and de-leverage activities.     Moody's stated the rating might be downgraded in case of unfavorable developments due to integration, the company's inability to attain or maintain debt leverage of 2.5x within 12 months or trading volumes and if transaction revenues decrease.  However, the ratings may be upgraded if debt/EBITDA remains below 2x, CBOE Holdings achieves the projected benefits from the acquisition, and its organic growth remains stable.     Benefits from the Integration      The acquisition of Bats Global will expand and diversify CBOE Holdings' product portfolio through the addition of U.S. and European cash equities, Global ETPs and Global FX. The combined entity will not only offer industry-leading market data products and services but will also enjoy a compelling global distribution network. This apart, the acquisition will expand CBOE Holdings global reach with solid pan-European equities and global FX positions. The acquirer's business mix would also be diversified as the deal will open up non-transactional revenue generating avenues.     CBOE Holdings is estimated to achieve $50 million in annualized expense synergies within three years of the acquisition. The metric is expected to increase to $65 million within five years of the closure of the transaction. The acquirer expects to achieve the synergies through its shift to a single proprietary trading platform and by optimizing the expense structure of the combined entity.     On the other hand, Bats Global shareholders stand to gain from immediate cash value as well as an opportunity to boost growth by leveraging CBOE Holdings' expertise.     The transaction will be accretive to the acquirer's bottom line in the first year post the closure of the acquisition. It will also help the company generate solid returns on invested capital.     Following the integration, Chris Concannon, who was formerly the CEO of Bats Global Markets, will become the President and COO of CBOE Holdings.     Acquisitions Ramping Growth Profile      CBOE Holdings, like other industry peers, has been facing intense competition as increased market consolidation tends to reduce market share and leverage of business. Hence, strategic acquisitions like the one mentioned above are expected to help the securities exchange retain its market share. Also, the industry is trying to counter soft trading volumes and margin contraction with more consolidations. Other securities exchange bigwigs like Nasdaq Inc. NDAQ  and Intercontinental Exchange Group Inc. ICE  have also undertaken strategic acquisitions to ramp up their growth.     Zacks Rank      CBOE Holdings currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

2018-07-12,"MarketAxess (MKTX) Gains on Top-Line Growth, High Costs Hurt","MarketAxess Holdings Inc. 's MKTX revenues have been consistently growing since 2005 (except 2008 when revenues declined just 0.6%). Revenues have witnessed a CAGR of 13% from 2012-2017. This top-line growth was primarily driven by persistent increase in commission (which forms the lion's share of total revenues) received on trading volumes. The same was up 11.4% in the first quarter of 2018. The company has been successful in increasing its trading volumes by way of inorganic and organic strategies.Its efforts of pursuing international opportunities, a compelling economic market model and a diversified product suite of the coveted U.S. high-grade floating rate and other credit bonds to broaden the scope of volumes growth for MarketAxess, going forward, will further drive commission revenues. The company is also witnessing an uptick in post-trade and services revenues mainly due to MiFID II implementation fees.MarketAxess supplements its organic growth by entering into strategic alliances, or by acquiring businesses or technologies, which enable it to enter new markets, provide new products or services. Some of the notable deals to this end included the acquisition of Xtrakter Limited which provided the company with an expanded set of technology solutions; a strategic alliance with BlackRock, Inc. which improved the range of trading connections available to global credit market participants; agreement with S&P Dow Jones Indices to jointly develop indices that will track the most liquid segments of the U.S. corporate bond market. The company's inorganic growth which has also aided top-line growth remains impressive.The company has been able to fund its acquisition backed by its strong liquidity position. Notably, it has been generating free cash flow from past several years. Strong liquidity not only mitigates balance-sheet risks, but also paves the way for an accelerated capital deployment in employees, trading platform, new products, geographic expansion and infrastructure.The company remains focused on enhancing shareholders' value through share buy and dividend hikes. Earlier this year, the company raised dividend by 27%, marking eight consecutive years of dividend hike.While MarketAxess' growth strategy has led to noticeable increase in the top and bottom line, escalating costs remain a significant headwind. Total expenses increased at 13% on average from 2013-2017, thereby weighing on the company's margins. In the first quarter of 2018, the same was up 14% year over year. We expect the company's expenses to rise over the coming quarters given its ongoing investments in several areas including trading platform, new protocols and infrastructure as well as headcount additions. Notably, for 2018, the company anticipates total expenses in the range of $220-$232 million. The midpoint of this range reflects about 15% year-over-year increase in expenses.Year to date, the stock has gained 1.2%, compared with the industry 's growth of 6.9%. Though this performance pales in comparison with the growth of 18.9%, 13.3%, 5.8% for Nasdaq, Inc. NDAQ , CME Group Inc. CME and Intercontinental Exchange Inc. ICE , respectively, the company's strong fundamentals should lift the stock in the coming quarters.MarketAxess carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

2017-12-11,Here's Why Bitcoin May Be The 'Bubble To End All Bubbles',"UBS' global chief economist on Monday said that Bitcoin's   rise to feverish heights over the past few months represents a   massive bubble, while the Securities and Exchange Commission said   it stopped another planned initial coin offering.[ibd-display-video id=3017249 width=50 float=left   autostart=true] ""The bubble to end all bubbles continues,"" the   economist, Paul Donovan, wrote in a   post    on Monday. ""Cryptocurrencies only have value if accepted as   currencies. However, they cannot be used for the most important   transaction in an economy, and cryptocurrency supply can only   rise and never fall (making them a poor store of value). To date,   using cryptocurrencies requires (effectively) a simultaneous   asset sale and purchase of goods or services.""In a recorded daily economics briefing, he added that the   rollout of new Bitcoin-tied futures contracts has ""fueled the   hysteria, but this was a bubble at $6,000 and it's a bubble at   $16,000.""The remarks from Donovan, who has expressed skepticism about   Bitcoin in the past, add to what has become a   near-daily ritual of takes    on the cryptocurrency from executives, economists, investors and   regulators.His remarks echo those from   Goldman Sachs    (   CEO    )   Lloyd Blankfein, who has also questioned    whether an asset that accumulates or spills thousands of dollars   in a day is actually a currency.""Something that moves up and down 20% in a day doesn't feel   like a currency, doesn't feel like a store of value,"" Blankfein   told Bloomberg Television last month.Those remarks, in turn, echoed something Donovan said in a   report in October, according to   CNBC    .""A 20-fold increase in bitcoin prices in just two years, and   an absence of any fundamental economic backing, cryptocurrency   prices are almost certainly a bubble,"" he wrote.   Folks in the pro-Bitcoin camp    argue that it is a misunderstood digital asset that is easier to   use and has the potential to transcend politics and central   banks. And the cryptocurrency continues to draw attention from   mainstream investors.   Cboe Global Markets    (   CBOE    ) launched its Bitcoin futures contracts on Sunday. Futures from   CME Group    (   CME    ) and   Nasdaq    (   NDAQ    ) are set to follow Dec. 18.     IBD'S TAKE:      Are Bitcoin, Ethereum and other digital currencies real     investments or a speculator's game? Individual investors should     be extremely cautious about diving into this new area. Read     this feature about     Bitcoin risks       and possible gains first.             The futures contracts could open up a path for a Bitcoin ETF   and give more investors a chance to bet for or against the   cryptocurrency without holding it directly. The futures could   also allow for more opportunity to take short positions against   Bitcoin and potentially tame its whipsaw pricing action.The cryptocurrency scene in general could also be tamed by   growing pressure from regulators. The SEC on Monday said that a   California-based company, Munchee, which provides a   blockchain-based food review service, had stopped a planned   initial coin offering after the agency found that the company's   actions ""constituted unregistered securities offers and   sales.""Last week, the SEC halted what it alleged was a ""fast-moving   Initial Coin Offering (ICO) fraud"" committed by a company called   PlexCorps that had raised as much as $15 million since August.   The SEC said the company had promised a 13-fold profit in under a   month. The charges stemming from that investigation were the   first to be filed by the SEC's new cyber unit.Munchee, the SEC said, agreed to a cease-and-desist order   without admitting to or denying the agency's findings.Meanwhile, the bumpy ride continued for Bitcoin stocks.   Riot Blockchain    (   RIOT    ), a company that invests in blockchain technology, soared 45.5%   to 23.08 in the      stock market today    after it said a payments company in its portfolio   intended to merge    with a company focused on mineral-resources exploration.   Bitcoin Investment Trust    (GBTC), an investment vehicle that attempts to track Bitcoin's   movements, burst 12% higher to 1,850.24 after briefly imploding   to as low as 75 cents.

2017-12-30,"Bitcoin Investors Are Irrational, and This Figure Proves It","Though we're just about to turn the page on 2017, we can   safely say that this year belonged to cryptocurrencies. At the   beginning of the year, all virtual currencies added together   would have yielded a market cap of $17.7 billion. However, as   recently as Dec. 21, 2017, the aggregate market cap of all   cryptocurrencies hit $654 billion, representing an increase in   value of almost 3,600%. This may very well be the   single greatest year we've ever witnessed    in terms of returns for a single asset class.Bitcoin, the largest virtual currency in the world by market   cap, can certainly take credit for a good chunk of this rally.   For much of the year, it comprised well over half of the   aggregate cryptocurrency market cap, and easily remains the most   popular altcoin to trade among investors. It's also accepted by   more merchants than any other digital currency. Having started   the year at $967 per coin, bitcoin nearly touched $20,000   recently, briefly surpassing a $300 billion market cap in the   process.           Image source: Getty Images.But I have news for you: Bitcoin investors probably aren't   rational, despite their excellent year-to-date gains.It's tough enough trying to gather a rational thesis to   support bitcoin's current valuation, but a   recently released survey    from LendEDU, an online marketplace for student loan refinancing,   shows just how out of touch with reality most bitcoin investors   are. LendEDU asked 565 American adults from across the country   the following question:""In 2018, do you think Bitcoin's investment returns will     exceed the returns of 2017?""The responses (and I hope you're sitting down for this):Mind you, when this study was released, bitcoin had increased   by more than 1,700% in value for the year. However, the survey   was actually conducted between Nov. 9 and Nov. 13, when the price   of bitcoin was hovering around $6,500-$7,000 per coin. It's   possible that the responses may have changed with the   understanding that bitcoin rose by $10,000 per coin since the   survey was conducted.Still, this suggests that fewer than 1 out of 10 people   surveyed believe bitcoin will rise by less than 550%-600% in   2018, while close to 8 out of 10 people are expecting bitcoin to   skyrocket at least by another 550%-600% after turning in a   once-in-a-lifetime year. If this were to come to fruition,   bitcoin would rocket to a $1.6 trillion market cap in 2018 and   sport a per-coin price of well over $100,000.           Image source: Getty Images.However, the chances of this rally persisting another year --   at least to the magnitude suggested by 77% of survey takers --   seems very unlikely. Here are a number of reasons why the wheels   on this bus could be ready to fall off.To begin with, retail investors, who are prone to investing   with their emotions on their sleeves, have primarily been in   control of the price movement in bitcoin and other   cryptocurrencies throughout 2017. Institutional investors have   mostly been keeping their distance because of the unregulated and   highly volatile nature of cryptocurrency markets and exchanges.   But that's   changing a bit    as we head into 2018.On Dec. 10,   CBOE Global Markets    (NASDAQ: CBOE) became the first platform to kick off bitcoin   futures trading, with   CME Group    (NASDAQ: CME)  following a week later on Dec. 17.   Nasdaq    (NASDAQ: NDAQ) has plans to begin offering a futures trading   platform, as well, sometime in the first or second quarter of   2018. Aside from providing a means to boost revenue for   CBOE, CME, and Nasdaq, futures trading offers the first real   opportunity for institutional investors to bet against bitcoin.   Prior to this, buying and selling was the only viable option,   with no real way to bet against a cryptocurrency and make money   if it fell.Furthermore, both the New York Stock Exchange and CBOE Global   Markets have   filed to list bitcoin ETFs    , or exchange-traded funds. These ETFs would track the   movement in bitcoin futures contracts rather than bitcoin itself,   but it would presumably make it worlds easier for institutional   investors and skeptics to place their bets against bitcoin. Long   story short, skeptics are going to have a much easier path to   exert their influence on bitcoin next year, which I suspect could   stop this rally in its tracks.           Image source: Getty Images.There's also the potential that government regulation could be   an impediment to bitcoin in 2018. Though it received a boost from   Japan, which accepted the virtual coin as legal tender this year,   cryptocurrencies and bitcoin could just as easily be banned by   other countries. In October, Russian President Vladimir Putin   condemned bitcoin, and suggested a ban on all cryptocurrencies.   This would be a blow to bitcoin, which already saw domestic   cryptocurrency exchanges shut down in China.We should also take into account just how bad Wall Street and   retail investors are at correctly predicting the uptake of new   technology. The emergence of cryptocurrencies is all about   replacing cash purchases with virtual currencies and the   rise of blockchain technology    , which is the digital and decentralized ledger that underlies   most cryptocurrencies and records all transactions.Retail investors have priced bitcoin and other cryptos as if   enterprises will open their arms and implement blockchain   immediately. Yet blockchain has been around for years, and only   now is getting tested in small-scale and pilot projects. While   this could be a game-changing technology, it's also going to take   time to be integrated into the financial-services and technology   industries. That could prove to be a   major letdown for investors    in 2018.History has shown that emotions can only carry an asset so   far, and 2018 could prove to be a reality check for bitcoin and   cryptocurrency investors.

2018-04-24,Can Marsh & McLennan (MMC) Q1 Earnings Beat on Revenues?,"Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc.   MMC  will release first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 26, before the market opens. Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 10.5%.Let's see, how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.The company's first-quarter results are expected to benefit from increased revenues at both its operating segments of Risk and Insurance Services as well as Consulting. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for net operating revenues is pegged at $3.8 billion, reflecting 8.5% year-over-year growth.The company's Risk and Insurance Services segment has been growing over the past several quarters on the back of accretive acquisitions and the trend is expected to continue in the to-be-reported quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for this segmental revenues is pegged at $2.2 billion, up 10% year over year.Also, the company's Consulting segment has been significantly contributing to the revenue base, riding on both organic and inorganic growth efforts. The consensus mark for revenues from this segment is $1.6 billion, representing 6.7% increase year over year.The company is expanding its footprint in the regions of Latin America, Asia, the Middle East and South Africa, which remain underexplored with high-growth potential. Performance from these regions is likely to boost overall results. Additionally, the company is widening its horizon into new businesses, which are expected to drive the top line.   Earnings Whispers Our proven model does not conclusively show that Marsh & McLennan is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP  and a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. But that is not the case here as you will see below.      Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc. Price and EPS   Surprise                   Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc. Price and EPS   Surprise    |      Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc. Quote     Zacks Rank  : Marsh & McLennan carries a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, a company needs to have a positive ESP to be confident about an earnings surprise. Hence, this combination leaves surprise prediction inconclusive. We caution against the Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.   Stocks to Consider Here are some companies from the Finance sector that you may want toconsider as these have the right combination of elements to beat estimates this quarter:Aflac Incorporated AFL  has an Earnings ESP of +1.73% and a Zacks Rank #2. The company is set to report first-quarter earnings on Apr 25. You can see    the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks   here.  Nasdaq, Inc.

2017-10-19,Essential Numbers and Themes to Watch in Nasdaq Inc.'s Q3 Earnings,"Nasdaq Inc.    (NASDAQ: NDAQ)  issues its third-quarter earnings report on   Wednesday, Oct. 25, before the start of trading. Last quarter,   Nasdaq booked   record net revenue and improved operating   profit    , and shareholders are keen for a continuation of the strong   performance. Let's briefly look at key numbers and themes that   investors will zero in on when Nasdaq's quarterly report is   issued.Trading revenue, which comprises about 25% of Nasdaq's       total top line, will likely prove a mixed bag next week.       According to Nasdaq's latest monthly trading report, which       was issued Oct. 9 and covers all three months of the third       quarter, U.S. equity options exhibited healthy volume growth       of 5.9%, as 364 million contracts were traded. Per the       report, it appears that revenue from this volume will be       offset by a drop of 17.5% in U.S. fixed income trading.However, it's a testament to management's efforts to       diversify the business that a strong performance from       Nasdaq's other primary revenue streams -- trade management       services, market technology, information services, and       corporate services -- will primarily determine the quarter's       fate. For reference, in the third quarter of 2016, Nasdaq       booked total net revenue of $585 million.Operating margin should shine as Nasdaq continues to see       lower acquisition-related expenses. While merger-integration       costs remain, the company is gradually absorbing transactions       like the June 2016 purchase of International Securities       Exchange. Due to this trend, in Q2 2017 Nasdaq enjoyed a leap       of 9.5 percentage points in operating margin, to 40.5%.If both net revenue and operating margin remain vigorous,       look for Nasdaq to post favorable bottom-line numbers versus       the comparable period. Last year in the third quarter, Nasdaq       generated net income of $131 million and diluted earnings per       share of $0.77.           Image source: Getty Images.In the company's last earnings call in late July, CEO Adena   Friedman promised that the integration of previous acquisitions   would remain a top priority for year-end. And CFO Michael   Ptasznik mentioned the company's goal to decrease Nasdaq's   debt-to-   EBITDA    ratio from a current reading of 3.0 to a more conservative 2.5 by   mid-2018, as acquisition-related borrowing has increased balance   sheet leverage. Yet both executives also indicated a willingness   to engage in new acquisitions if a proposed deal helped the   company further its strategic goals.It didn't take long for opportunity to arise. Last month,   Nasdaq initiated its latest in a seemingly unending stream of   M&A transactions, announcing its intent to   purchase eVestment, a data and analytics firm that assists   asset and fund managers in making institutional investment   decisions.The deal is valued at $705 million and is expected to close by   year-end. On Sept. 22, Nasdaq issued $500 million in senior   notes, due in 2019, to fund the purchase. Next week, we can   expect management to discuss both the rationale for the   acquisition, and the bearing it has on Nasdaq's targeted   borrowing reduction.While the company is bulking up its information services   segment with the addition of eVestment, it's also culling revenue   streams it no longer considers core services. This month, Nasdaq   announced that it's exploring options to divest its public   relations solutions and digital media services units, which   reside in its corporate services segment. This reflects a   fine-tuning of company strategy, in which providing data   analytics and trading technology services to customers will take   precedence over the maintenance of lower-return   businesses. Trimming noncore operations will likely figure   as a topic in management's earnings conference call next   week.Finally, shareholders will want to check the ever-important   barometer of Nasdaq's health, its overall listings statistics and   share of initial public offerings (IPOs) won. From the monthly   trading report mentioned above, we know in advance that total   corporate listings on the company's various exchanges grew   roughly 4%, to 3,887, by the end of the third quarter.In the second quarter of this year, the Nasdaq Stock Market   won 52% of all U.S. IPOs. Snaring a predominance of IPO listings   has been a point of pride for Nasdaq for quite a while now, and   the third quarter shouldn't prove an exception. We'll provide the   tally on IPOs, and review the key numbers and themes discussed   above, in our earnings recap after the company reports next   Wednesday.          10 stocks we like better than Nasdaq            When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

2018-06-06,"CME Group's (CME) May Volume Figures Strong, Shares Rise","CME Group Inc  .'s CME  average daily volume (ADV) of 20.1 million contracts per day for May 2018 improved 22% year over year. A record daily volume of 51.9 million contracts traded on May 29 largely drove this upside. Shares gained 1.7% in the last two trading years reflecting investor optimism.           CME Group's improving volumes are cushioned by a solid operating leverage, helping it maintain an enormous market share. The company holds about 90% market share of the global futures trading and clearing services. Expansion of futures products in the emerging markets plus a rise in non-transaction related opportunities and over-the-counter offerings should continue to contribute modestly to its top-line growth in the years ahead.     The company is also deepening its focus on over-the-counter clearing services with respect to interest rate swaps and foreign exchange. Efforts to expand and cross-sell via strategic alliances, judicious acquisitions, product launches as well as widening the company's global footprint should also drive its overall growth.

2017-09-06,Nasdaq to Boost Information Services with eVestment Buyout,"Nasdaq Inc.NDAQ has announced that it will buy eVestment for $705 million. The transaction is expected to culminate in the fourth quarter of 2017. The acquisition will help Nasdaq boost its global information services business. The company will fund the acquisition through cash and debt.Acquisition Rationale eVestment is an industry leading content and analytics provider. Asset managers, investment consultants and asset owners use its 2,800 individual data points on more than 74,000 investment vehicles for decision making.  eVestment boasts client base of 2,000 including 92% of the top asset managers, 76% of the top consulting firms and 80% of the top 20 pension funds. eVestment along with Nasdaq's surveillance technology, SMARTS, Analytics Hub and Mutual Fund Quotation Service operations will help the acquirer expand buy side relationships. This move reflects Nasdaq's strategic initiatives to grow by diversifying its business beyond hosting stock trading. Addition of eVestment will ensure revenue and cash flow generation, apart from cushioning solid growth for Nasdaq that in turn will also enhance the acquirer's shareholder returns. On the other hand, eVestment stands to gain from Nasdaq's global presence. Per Jim Minnick, Chief Executive Officer and Co-founder, eVestment has its business boomed 12% annually since 2013. Leveraging Nasdaq's information services offerings, eVestment can also boost its capabilities to serve clients better. Nasdaq expects this acquisition to help generate double-digit shareholder returns. The Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) securities exchange intends to lower leverage while focusing on capital deployment by increasing dividend and pursuing share buybacks.Impressive Inorganic Growth Story Nasdaq has grown meaningfully over the years through a number of strategic expansions. Acquisition of Chi-X Canada aided Nasdaq to gain direct access to the Canadian equities market. Marketwired and Boardvantage acquisitions fortified its Corporate Solutions business while International Securities Exchange expanded its technology offering. Nasdaq identified between $10 million and $20 million as additional synergies to be realized once platform transitions conclude. Earlier in July, Nasdaq had agreed to purchase Sybenetix to ramp up its buy-side product offerings.Nasdaq's shares have gained 4.0% quarter to date, outperforming the 0.6% increase of the industry . Strategic initiatives undertaken by the company to feed its product and service capabilities, which in turn fuel growth, should continue to drive the shares higher. Players in the securities and exchange industry have been facing severe competition as increased market consolidation tends to reduce market share and leverage rate of business. Hence, strategic takeovers like the one mentioned above are expected to help the securities exchange retain its market space.Stocks to Consider Some better-ranked stocks from the insurance industry are Atlas Financial Holdings, Inc. AFH , Markel Corporation MKL and Mercury General Corporation MCY , each sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here .

2017-01-30,NASDAQ Earnings Preview: Recovery In Trading Volumes Likely To Boost Top-Line,"Non-Transaction Businesses Are Likely To Drive GrowthNasdaq's non-trading business lines, including information, technology and listing services, generate around 40% of the overall revenues. These businesses grew over 10% in the first 9 months of 2016. There has been a recent series of acquisitions that have strengthened the existing technology and information services segments. As such, we believe the increased uptake of products will aid the revenue growth. Moreover, the in-house products have attracted a lot of customers since their launch early in the year.  These include IR Insights, which is capable of incorporating news, recommendations, and trackers on a single platform, and Nasdaq Influencer, through which marketing professionals from different companies can connect with veterans in their industry to promote their brand and share insights and recommendations,Increased Volatility Shoots Trading VolumesThe market services segment, which contributes around 60% of Nasdaq's overall revenues, grew around 4% in the first nine months of 2016. The trading volumes recovered in the last quarter and this is likely to boost the segment's revenues. The acquisition of ISE has secured NASDAQ the leading position in equity options trading . With around 40% market share in the U.S., the volumes have gone up by 50% year over year.Cash equity volumes grew nearly 2% yin Q4 2016 compared to Q4 2015, aided by the increased volatility in the stock market.Fixed income trading volumes also saw 5% growth. The growth in trading volumes across all product line is likely to benefit the market services revenue.Please refer to the full Trefis analysis for NasdaqView Interactive Institutional Research (Powered by Trefis):Global Large Cap | U.S. Mid & Small Cap | European Large & Mid Cap The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."
2018-02-01,Non-Trading Activities Propel Nasdaq's Positive Fourth Quarter,"In a quarter in which net trading revenue barely budged,   Nasdaq Inc.    (NASDAQ: NDAQ)  found the key to top-line growth in its   corporate, information, and market technology services. We'll   drill into the company's fourth-quarter 2017 earnings report,   released Wednesday, after a run through the headline metrics   directly below.     Data source: Nasdaq Inc.A net revenue increase of $36 million over the fourth       quarter of 2016 was comprised of 3% organic growth, 1%       acquisition-related growth, and 2 percentage points of       favorable foreign currency translation.Operating margin improved nearly 3 percentage points       against the prior-year quarter, to 38.3%. Total operating       expenses increased just $6 million versus the comparable       quarter, to $292 million, and in turn, the growth on the top       line provided favorable operating leverage. As I discussed       last quarter        , Nasdaq's recent cost control discipline should benefit       shareholders over the long term.Impressively, Nasdaq's top line expanded without much help       from trading activities within its largest segment, market       services. Market services' net revenue increased just $3       million, to $222 million, as a $3 million drop in organic       revenue was offset by a foreign currency translation benefit       of $5 million. The organic revenue weakness stemmed from       slimmer revenue from U.S. options, but management noted that       the company still expanded its share of the U.S. options       market during the quarter.Corporate services, Nasdaq's second-largest segment, also       increased revenue modestly, by $3 million during the quarter,       to $170 million.The information services and market technology segments       provided the bulk of Nasdaq's year-over-year quarterly       revenue advance. Information services added $21 million to       its top line over the fourth quarter of 2016, to $156       million. This 16% increase was propelled by Nasdaq's booming       index licensing business. Market technology booked a $10       million revenue advance, to $88 million, with $8 million       attributed to organic growth. The market technology segment       ended the fourth quarter with a record order backlog of $847       million.Nasdaq continued to exhibit its listing prowess during the       fourth quarter. Most notably, consumer goods giant       PepsiCo Inc.         switched its listing to Nasdaq, transferring $169       billion of market capitalization to Nasdaq from rival       exchange NYSE and thus becoming the largest listing transfer       in Nasdaq's history. According to the company, since 2005       it's taken $1.2 trillion in market capitalization from NYSE       via switched listings.For the year, Nasdaq again led all exchanges in the U.S.       initial public offering market, garnering 63% of all IPOs in       2017.                                            Image source: Nasdaq, Inc.Nasdaq's balanced quarter, in which services revenue more than   compensated for slim trading growth, demonstrates the progress   the company has made in its effort to broaden its revenue streams   through analytics, technology, indexing, and listing service   offerings, often through small acquisitions. During the company's   post-earnings conference call, CEO Adena Friedman pointed out the   vigorous growth of eVestment, a provider of analytics to   institutional investors, which Nasdaq purchased for $700 million   in 2017:We've been very pleased to see eVestment's strong momentum     continues for the fourth quarter. eVestment's top-line     stand-alone results in the fourth quarter of 2017 grew 13%     year-over-year to $23 million. And in terms of metrics that     drive future periods, new subscription sales in the fourth     quarter rose 77% and the retention rate was 5 percentage points     higher versus the prior year fourth quarter.Acquisitions like eVestment are especially promising for   Nasdaq, as their revenue momentum within specific disciplines (in   this case, trading analytics for large institutions) can be   supported through Nasdaq's in-house resources and   capabilities.Rather than providing detailed forward guidance, Nasdaq tends   to simply project its non-   GAAP     operating expense each year for shareholders. The   organization released its projection on Wednesday for full-year   non-GAAP operating expense to fall between $1.375 billion and   $1.415 billion.At the midpoint of this range, Nasdaq will see its operating   expense rise roughly 9% from full-year 2017 operating expense of   $1.280 billion. The increase is composed of 3% organic expense   growth and 1.5% of currency translation effects, with the   remainder related to late 2017 acquisitions, including eVestment   and surveillance specialist Sybenetix.Management relayed Wednesday that the timing of acquisition   expenses and realization of merger synergies might cause some   revision to the expected full-year expense tally. Thus, investors   should use the non-GAAP expense number as a ballpark figure as we   head into the first half of 2018.          10 stocks we like better than Nasdaq            When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

2017-05-04,Key Takeaways From ICE's Q1 Earnings,"Trading Volumes Remain Under Pressure The company's clearing and transaction fees, which contributed around 43% of ICE's overall revenues, declined by over 9% from the prior first quarter. Among the various asset classes, equity options suffered the most with over a 28% drop in trading volumes. Although we attribute a part of it to the industry-wide decline in a relatively less volatile quarter, we are concerned about the significant loss of market share from Q1 2016 by over 5 percentage points to around 14%Among  commodities, energy derivatives saw marginal growth. Without much volatility in oil prices and OPEC's stance on capping production, trading activity in the asset class has been fairly muted. The growth in financial derivatives was largely driven by the significant surge in interest rate derivative volumes. With the expectations of a few rate hikes, we expect the growth momentum to sustain in the near term.   Data Services Continued Growth Due To Global Demand,   Acquisitions ICE's data services business generate around 45% of the company's overall revenues. This business grew by around 9% in the first quarter. A third of the growth in this segment is attributed to these acquisitions made by ICE in the prior year. With increasing demand for data-driven insights and analytics-driven recommendations, we believe these acquisitions have helped it expand its market reach, add technology platforms and increase risk management, new data and valuation services. As the competition for trading has intensified, the exchange's move in strengthening its data services segment seems like a good move to offset the losses from decline in trading commissions. Moreover, its diverse asset class and global expanse bear a great potential to expand this business.Please refer to    the full Trefis analysis for Intercontinental   Exchange.

2017-09-19,Nasdaq to Boost Market Surveillance With Sybenetix Buyout,"Nasdaq, Inc.NDAQ has recently completed the buyout of London-based startup Sybenetix, an industry-leading surveillance provider that brings together behavioral analytics and cognitive computing offering financial markets expertise. The acquisition will not only help Nasdaq expand market technology business but also enable the securities exchange to improve its market surveillance techniques.Details of the Transaction Nasdaq inked the deal to acquire Sybenetix on Jul 25, 2017. However, the securities exchange has not disclosed the purchase price of the transaction but aims to fund the same with cash in hand. Notably, the buyout marks the first transaction since the appointment of Adena Friedman, Chief Executive Officer of Nasdaq.Benefits of the Acquisition The takeover will allow Nasdaq to extend its current market surveillance technology to ultimately help the securities exchange further strengthen and expand position in the surveillance space, thereby enabling the company to become a leading provider to the buy-side industry. Hence, the transaction will permit the company to invest more into advanced technologies like cognitive computing, which is a very important part of the company's strategy. Thus, the securities exchange will be able to further improve its service portfolio to boost overall results and result in long-term growth. With this transaction, Nasdaq will be able to fulfill its primary objective of making an entry into the buy-side market with a compliance solution. Also, the buyout will help enhance the company's risk management solutions, as Sybenetix will assist compliance officers at asset management firms to help detect market abuse by analyzing the traders' behavior. This will be made possible by using an advanced technology, referred to as artificial intelligence. Additionally, the buyout will aid Nasdaq in creating solutions to provide data analysis that will venture beyond trading records to better identify conduct risk. Amid a volatile market environment, increasing competition and regulatory changes, Nasdaq has diversified its operations beyond traditional exchange businesses. This move mainly came due to lower profitability of equity trading over the past decade. Also, expansion of market technology will significantly contribute to the company's overall growth. Thus, the acquisition is anticipated to boost company's prosperity in the near future.On the other hand, Sybenetix will benefit from using Nasdaq's platform to draw massive growth opportunities for its surveillance technologies. In turn, the company will expedite new product development for the buy-side industry. Interestingly, Nasdaq has been boosting its inorganic growth by making prudent acquisitions. To that end, on Sep 5, 2017, the company agreed to acquire eVestment for $705 million. The transaction is expected to culminate in the fourth quarter of 2017. The acquisition will help Nasdaq boost its global information services business.Zacks Rank and Share Price Movement Currently Nasdaq carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

2017-12-19,A Closer Look At CME's Performance In 2017,"We have a $120 price estimate for CME's stock  , which is below the current market price.   Interest Rate Derivatives Continued To Grow Under Fed   Guidance Interest rate derivatives have been the highest in terms of trading volumes, with around 10% year-to-date growth. The Fed's interest rate hikes led to a significant increase in derivative volumes throughout the year. However, a tough year-on-year comp - due to significant growth in November 2016 - led to a 21% decline in November 2017.          Oil Prices Have Led To Improved Volumes The demand-supply gap led to increased volatility in the oil market throughout the last couple of years. Oil prices have continued to fluctuate due to OPEC's stance on capping production. This propelled 6% year-to-date growth in energy derivative volumes. Since the outlook for the restricted production of oil remains uncertain, we expect the market volatility to sustain in the near term, thus leading to continued growth in trading volumes.           Bitcoin Demand, Market Data Business Suggest Positive   Growth Outlook CME has recently launched bitcoin futures trading on its platform. With this initiative, the company is looking to get an early movers' advantage in the volatile but fast-growing asset class. With strong global demand, bitcoin prices have risen more 15x since the beginning of 2017. Out of a total limit of 21 million bitcoins which can be mined, based on the existing protocol, the current bitcoins in circulation stands around 16.7 million. With the growth in supply slowing down, bitcoin trading provides a solid opportunity for exchanges. Over the long run, this could provide a healthy boost to CME's trading volumes.Despite recent mixed results, the company remains bullish on its Market Data and Information Services segment, with new products in the pipeline with enhanced business intelligence and machine learning capabilities. The company has gained traction by offering many data services to its customers free of charge until recently, and we expect that many of its existing customers will be willing to pay for more advanced products.Please refer to    the full Trefis analysis for CME Group.

2017-01-30,Is a Beat in Store for Nasdaq (NDAQ) this Earnings Season?,"We expect Nasdaq, Inc.NDAQ to beat earnings expectations when it reports its fourth-quarter and full-year 2016 results on Jan 31.Why a Likely Positive Surprise? Our proven model shows that Nasdaq has the right combination of two key ingredients to beat earnings.Positive Zacks ESP : Earnings ESP , which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is pegged at +1.06%. This is a major indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise for the company. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they're reported with our Earnings ESP Filter .Zacks Rank : Nasdaq carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Note that stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) and 3 have a significantly higher chance of beating earnings. The combination of Nasdaq's Zacks Rank #3 and ESP of +1.06% makes us confident of an earnings beat on Jan 31. Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 94 cents reflects a year-over-year increase of 5.8%.Factors to Influence Q4 Results Nasdaq's quarterly results are likely to get support from its organic growth initiatives as well as strategic acquisitions in the year, including International Securities Exchange, Marketwired and Boardvantage. Top line should also benefit from the company's consistent focus on its strategy to accelerate its non-transaction revenue base, which includes technology, listing and information revenues. Notably, during third-quarter 2016, the company witnessed  5% organic net revenue growth across the non-trading segments, which provide the bulk of  the subscription and recurring revenues, driven by strong growth in technology solutions segment. Earlier this month, Nasdaq reported trading volumes for fourth-quarter 2016 and provided estimated revenue capture for the quarter. This major exchange operator's U.S. equity options volume surged nearly 49%, year over year, during fourth-quarter 2016. Projected revenue capture per contract (RPC) for the quarter is pegged at 16 cents, flat year over year. European options and futures volume was down 13.5% year over year. Estimated RPC reflects a 9.5% year-over-year increase to 46 cents. Among others, Nasdaq's U.S. matched shares declined 7% from the prior-year period. Estimated revenue capture per 1,000 shares reflects a decline of 7.5%, on a year-over-year basis, to 49 cents.  The U.S. Fixed income volume for the quarter was up 3%, while European fixed-income volume climbed 15.2%. Overall the quarterly trading volume report reflected a mixed performance, while the strengthening of the U.S. dollar is likely to have weighed on the European operations to some extent. Regarding expenses, Nasdaq had narrowed its 2016 operating expense guidance to a range of $1.22-$1.24 billion. However, for fourth-quarter 2016, the company projected operating expenses in the range of $323-$343 million, reflecting a sequential rise. Notably, Nasdaq has reported a positive earnings surprise, with an average beat of 1.4% for the trailing four quarters.Nasdaq, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseNasdaq, Inc.

2017-05-23,3 Facts You Didn't Know About the Nasdaq,"If you visit stock listings regularly, or you frequently check   your stocks portfolios online, you will probably also see results   for three key market measures -- the Dow Jones Industrial Average   (""the Dow""), the S&P 500, and the Nasdaq Composite. Most   people are familiar with the Dow, and the S&P 500 has become   better known in large part because index funds based on it have   become much more widely used.Let's take a closer look at the   Nasdaq    , though, as it's often underappreciated -- despite being the   world's second-largest stock exchange (measured by market   capitalization), after the   New York Stock Exchange    (NYSE).           Image source: Getty Images.For starters, the Nasdaq has been around for quite a while. It   began in 1971, and ""NASDAQ"" stood for the National   Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotations. It was an   innovation, offering a more efficient way for stocks to be traded   -- in an automated, computerized manner instead of in the   old-fashioned in-person way, such as on the floor of the New York   Stock Exchange. It utilized computer bulletin boards and   telephones.Over the years the Nasdaq bought other exchanges, such as the   Boston Stock Exchange and the Philadelphia Stock Exchange. The   Philadelphia exchange was the nation's oldest -- two years older   than the New York Stock Exchange -- so now the Nasdaq can trace   its roots back to 1790. Over time, the Nasdaq became home to many   younger and faster-growing companies than the more established   ones that tended to populate the New York Stock Exchange, in part   because the Nasdaq listing fees were lower.Today the Nasdaq is the largest electronic stock market, with   the highest trading volume among U.S. exchanges and with more   than 3,000 listed companies that recently totaled   about $11 trillion in value. The biggest company on the   Nasdaq is also the biggest in the world --   Apple     -- at a market value recently near $800 billion.           Image source: Getty Images.Few people realize that   Nasdaq    (NASDAQ: NDAQ) is also a publicly traded company. Based in New   York City and currently led by CEO Adena Friedman, it   recently sported a market capitalization of about $11 billion --   greater than companies such as   Wyndham Worldwide    ,   Harley-Davidson    ,   Gap    , and   Domino's Pizza    .Nasdaq the stock pays a dividend, too, recently yielding about   2.3%. Its beta of 0.62 reflects lower-than-average   volatility, and the fact that its price-to-earnings (P/E) and   price-to-sales ratios were recently well above their   five-year averages suggests that the stock is not a bargain right   now.           Image source :Getty Images.The Nasdaq is a stock market, not a stock index, but that   doesn't mean there aren't Nasdaq-focused indices.The main Nasdaq index is the Nasdaq Composite, which reflects   all the 3,000-plus components of the Nasdaq stock market. When   you hear that ""the Nasdaq"" rose a few points or fell some, the   Nasdaq Composite index is what's being referred to.The Nasdaq 100 is a rather prominent index, too, featuring   roughly 100 holdings. Making its debut in 1985, it's a widely   followed index today, averaging annual returns of about   10.8% over the past 15 years, compared with only 7.4% for the   S&P 500. It's a tech-heavy index, without any financial   companies in it. It's market-cap-weighted, too, meaning that the   largest companies in it (in terms of market cap) will wield the   biggest influence on it. Its main components are Apple,   Microsoft    ,   Amazon.com    ,   Facebook    , Google parent   Alphabet    , and   Comcast    . You can invest in the Nasdaq 100 through the   PowerShares QQQ ETF    (NASDAQ: QQQ) .

2017-11-30,"Bitcoin Retreats As Goldman CEO, Fed's Quarles Raise Doubts","Bitcoin continued to trade wildly on Thursday, a day after   swelling past $11,000    and then face-planted at below $10,000, as   Goldman Sachs    (   GS    ) CEO Lloyd Blankfein said the cryptocurrency doesn't meet   traditional standards for money while a top Federal Reserve   policymaker said Bitcoin is a ""niche product.""[ibd-display-video id=2994904 width=50 float=left   autostart=true] The digital currency, ever sensitive to price   swings and the emotions of big and small investors alike, was   down 2.8% to $9,540.14 in afternoon trading after sinking to   $9,021 intraday. Etherium, another cryptocurrency, was down 2.4%   to $427.51, but off their worst levels too.Last week, Bitcoin hovered in the $8,000 range. The latest big   price swings come as more smaller, less sophisticated investors,   curious about the hype, hop aboard and then bail on what has   become a wild ride this year for the cryptocurrency.Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein said Thursday that it's too   soon for his bank to develop a Bitcoin strategy, and questioned   calling the digital instrument a ""currency.""""Something that moves up and down 20% in a day doesn't feel   like a currency, doesn't feel like a store of value,"" Blankefein   told   Bloomberg Television    .Goldman's commodity chief said Wednesday that Bitcoin should   be treated as a commodity.Federal Reserve Vice Chairman for Supervision Randal   Quarles said Thursday dismissed the idea that Bitcoin could be a   major rival to established currencies or that the Fed itself   would issue its own cryptocurrency.""Digital currencies are a niche product that sometimes garners   large headlines,"" Quarles said. He warned that digital currencies   could pose ""serious financial stability issues"" if they became   widely used.A Bank of England official on Wednesday downplayed the risks   of the cryptocurrency, but urged caution nonetheless.""This is not at a size where it's a macroeconomic risk to the   global economy,"" Jon Cunliffe, a deputy governor with the central   bank, told BBC Radio 5 Live, according to the Guardian, ""but when   prices are moving like that, my view would be investors need to   do their homework.""But Joseph Stiglitz, the World Bank's former chief economist   and a Nobel Prize winner,   told Bloomberg     on Wednesday that ""Bitcoin is successful only because of   its potential for circumvention, lack of oversight. So it seems   to me it ought to be outlawed.""David Mondrus, CEO of the blockchain company Trive, took issue   with that comment.""Yes, circumvention of third parties, including government is   one of the major uses/cases of Bitcoin,"" he said in an emailed   statement on Wednesday, ""but it is precisely because of the   failure and overreach of such parties that it was invented.""He added: ""Maybe it's time we stopped relying on third   parties, governments and regulators to keep us safe and relied on   ourselves.""Also Wednesday, U.S. authorities appeared to tighten the   screws on the cryptocurrency. A federal court in California has   told the trading platform Coinbase to submit to the IRS   information about anyone who has moved $20,000 or more through   their accounts annually between 2013 and 2015, according to   the Verge.   Bloomberg reported Wednesday that the biggest declines that   day occurred as some trading platforms experienced hiccups in   service amid some immense traffic volumes.Despite the growing skepticism,   Nasdaq    (   NDAQ    ) and Cantor Fitzgerald plan to launch Bitcoin futures, following   similar decisions by   CME Group    (   CME    ) and   CBOE    (   CBOE    ).Crypto-related stock and investments were also volatile in the      stock market today    , including Bitcoin Investment Trust (   GBTC    ),   Overstock    (OSTK),   Riot Blockchain    (RIOT) and   Marathon Patent Group    (MARA).Bitcoin investment vehicle Bitcoin Investment Trust rose 1.4%,   rebounding from much-steeper losses. Overstock, which takes   Bitcoin and has focused more on the record-keeping technology   behind the cryptocurrency known as blockchain, lost   9.4%. Marathon Patent, an IP licensing firm set   to acquire the cryptocurrency miner Global Bit Ventures,   bounced back 3%. Riot Blockchain, which manages   record-keeping technology behind bitcoin    , gained 3%.   Square    (SQ), which is testing out letting some Square Cash users buy and   sell Bitcoin, rose 0.2%.   Nvidia    (NVDA) and   Advanced Micro Devices    (AMD), whose graphics cards are used in the processing of   cryptocurrency transactions, rose 2.2% and 0.55%,   respectively.  Square, Nvidia and AMD were caught up in   Wednesday's tech sell-off.

2018-03-02,A Marijuana First: This Canadian Pot Stock Just Uplisted to the Nasdaq,"Whether you're ready or not, the marijuana industry is budding   before our eyes. Leading cannabis research firm ArcView has   estimated that the North American market could grow sales by an   average of 26% annually between 2016 and 2021, leading to nearly   $22 billion in annual sales. This growth, coupled with growing   favorability toward pot among the public, is a big reason why   marijuana stocks have soared.However, not every cannabis market is necessarily thriving if   you dig below the surface. Despite rapidly growing sales in the   U.S., pot-based businesses   aren't exactly flourishing    . The U.S. federal government has dug in its heels and refuses to   alter its Schedule I classification of cannabis, meaning it's   entirely illegal, prone to abuse, and recognized as having no   medical benefits. This classification makes life extremely   difficult for U.S.-based marijuana businesses, and even medical   patients. And, to boot, Attorney General Jeff Sessions is doing   everything imaginable to wage war on the cannabis industry and   halt its expansion.           Image source: Getty Images.Meanwhile, Canada has laid out a blueprint for pot   progressivism. Having already legalized medical marijuana back in   2001, Canada's federal government is currently reviewing   legislation that would make adult-use weed legal by this coming   summer. A Senate vote is scheduled for June 7, with the   expectation that adult consumers could legally buy cannabis in   dispensaries   by August or September    , if approved. Legalization could mean an additional $5 billion   in annual sales, which is a big reason why investors are blinded   by dollar signs at the moment.If you're looking to get your feet wet by investing in   marijuana stocks, Canada is the place to be right now. Growers   are expanding their capacity as quickly as their balance sheets   will allow, while investment companies are busy diversifying   their cannabis assets throughout Canada.Yet, one drawback of Canada's cannabis success, at least for   U.S. investors, has been the need to turn to the over-the-counter   (OTC) market, which is where Canadian pot stocks are usually   listed, in order to take advantage of this expected legalization   and industry expansion. While the OTC boards have made   significant regulatory strides over the past decade, liquidity,   and access to up-to-date financial information, can occasionally   be challenging. That's why most institutional and seasoned   investors prefer to keep their money on reputable exchanges, such   as the NYSE or   Nasdaq    (NASDAQ: NDAQ) .           Image source: Nasdaq.However, cannabis investment firm   Cronos Group    (NASDAQ: CRON)  is pioneering a shift that could get more   Americans involved in the Canadian green rush. On Feb. 27, Cronos   Group uplisted from the Nasdaq International Designation program,   where it traded under the ""PRMCF"" ticker symbol, to the Nasdaq   Global Market. It now can be found under the ""CRON"" ticker   symbol. Though there are other cannabis companies listed on the   Nasdaq Global Market, such as cannabinoid-drug developer   GW Pharmaceuticals    , Cronos becomes the first Canadian marijuana stock to have   uplisted from Nasdaq International, and it wouldn't be surprising   if others followed suit.Said Mike Gorenstein, CEO of Cronos Group, ""This up listing to   NASDAQ is a major corporate milestone and reflects the   significant progress we have made in strengthening our corporate   governance and expanding our global footprint. We believe this   will increase long term shareholder value by improving awareness,   liquidity, and appeal to institutional investors.""However, uplisting to the Nasdaq, and appearing more palatable   to institutional investors, is nothing more than a short-term   driver for Cronos Group. If its market cap is to move   significantly higher, we're going to need to see its business   model pay off.           Image source: Getty Images.Unlike traditional weed growers that are intricately involved   in their day-to-day operations, Cronos Group has taken the role   of principal investor, with   three core assets    . It has complete ownership of Peace Naturals and Original BC,   and owns 21.5% of Whistler Medical Marijuana Company. All of   these assets focus on medical cannabis, but can presumably switch   their focus to include recreational weed, if approved.   Additionally, Whistler Medical Marijuana and Peace Naturals   generate significant sales from cannabis oils, which are a   considerably higher price and higher-margin product. In short,   legalization does matter for Cronos, as does the ability of its   core assets to produce and sells cannabis oils.Furthermore, Cronos has access to a number of international   markets. Aside from its Canadian core assets, it exports to   Germany, giving it a path to more than 12,000 pharmacies; it's   building a production facility in Israel in a joint venture with   Kibbutz Gan Shmuel; and it has an avenue into the Australian   market through a licensed joint venture with NewSouthern   Capital. This should help create some geographic revenue   diversity and reduce any potential hiccups in cannabis   demand.Though I appreciate Cronos's unique investment approach,   rapid sales growth    , and Wall Street's expectation that it'll be marginally   profitable in fiscal 2018, I struggle to overlook its nearly $1.5   billion market cap. Even with the potential for robust margins,   this is an aggressive valuation that'd I'd probably suggest   investors pass on for now.          10 stocks we like better than Cronos Group Inc     NPV            When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Click here           to learn about these picks!*Stock Advisor returns as of September 5, 2017                                          This video was recorded on Sept. 13, 2017.      Mac Greer:    Let's move on to bitcoin, a subject that we all   know evokes some very strong opinions for and against.   Speaking at an investment conference on   Tuesday, JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon called bitcoin   a ""fraud."" Dimon said he supported blockchain technology but   said that bitcoin was ""stupid"" and ""far too dangerous."" So guys,   what do you think? Bitcoin, digital currency. Is it a fraud? Is   it the next great thing? Or is it somewhere in the   middle?   Aaron Bush:    I think it's definitely not a fraud. And I think even if   bitcoin exactly isn't the next great thing,   its creation was the start of something great. No, I   don't think it was a fraud. And as I think back over   what Jamie Dimon says, Buffett at one point called the value   of bitcoin a mirage. Howard Marks has been all wishy-washy on it,   too. My personal opinion is that they're all wrong. I think   there definitely is hype in the market,   there definitely is, beyond a doubt. But at the same time,   there is true value in what bitcoin has done, creating   a decentralized network without a central authority that can   shift money around with complete trust. That's a huge   breakthrough.And I think what people are underestimating, and   these are people who are good at finance but   aren't necessarily great at understanding the computer   science -- I think they're understanding what can be   built on top of it. As you add Layer 2 functionality   -- that's the equivalent of saying, on the internet, we   create an HTTP, bitcoin would be similar to something like   HTTP, but now think about all the things that we've built on   top of HTTP. I think we're going to start to see more use   cases and applications be built where we can use bitcoin.And honestly, people solely talk about it as a currency.   And I think that's how it was created. It was created to be   a peer-to-peer payment platform. But I think it's evolved to   be more than that. So yes, it can be used as a   currency, but the reality is, people don't trade things that   go up, so they're holding on to it, which has made it a   store of value. So I think the best metric for measuring bitcoin   isn't transactions of volumes; it's just the number of   believers. And whatever these guys say, as long as the   number of believers is going up, the value of bitcoin should   go up, too.   Greer:    David?   David Kretzmann:    Yeah, looking longer-term, I think it's inevitable   that this technology will be implemented and utilized in   some shape or form, whether it's bitcoin or ethereum or   some other concoction that hasn't even been created yet.   That's impossible to say. But over the long run, I think it's   inevitable that the world goes this direction.With that said, in the short term, from an investor's   lens, it really seems overheated to me right now. I have a lot of   friends who, fairly regularly over the last couple of   months, will come up to me, and these are people who   probably aren't even invested in stocks yet, and they're asking,   ""What do you think about bitcoin? Is there something there?""   And to me, it's reminiscent of the '90s, when everyone was   talking about tech stocks -- ""you just have to get in on   this."" So I think a lot of people right now are looking at it   through more of a short-term lens. They're trying to buy it and   make a quick buck. They're not actually interested in using   it as a currency.Longer-term, I think we'll have some sort of correction   or crash where it weeds out some of that, similar to the days of   the dot-com bubble, where you had some legitimate businesses   and visionaries like Jeff Bezos and   Amazon     and   eBay     that got punished hard during crash, but they managed   to come through it and ended up   really revolutionizing the world. I wouldn't be   surprised if there were some similarities there with bitcoin and   cryptocurrency and the blockchain and all of those different   buzzwords right now. But in the short term, it's very   speculative, so I wouldn't put anything in bitcoin that   I wouldn't be willing to lose.   Bush:    Yeah, I kind of think of the entire cryptocurrency   industry in a stage where the internet was in the early '90s   or so. The difference is that this industry is moving a   lot faster. It's developing a lot faster. It still isn't   perfect. There's still a lot of lacking infrastructure out there.   The developer experience isn't great yet, and the user   experience still is kind of limited to only techies who know how   to move around money in this way who can really figure this out.   But that will change in time. And added infrastructure   will make it more usable.Lastly, I'll just say that the whole idea of   tokenization is essentially the creation of a new asset   class that works differently from equities, bonds. And what   we've seen even over the past quarter, there have been   a couple ICOs, initial coin offerings, that have   raised significant money, like over $200 million each. And   even apart from the currency side, just blockchain, all   of these big finance businesses and non-finance businesses   are coming together under these consortia, and the   largest consortium raised, I forget, it was like $100   million or $200 just last quarter. So even if it's   hype, the fact that it's hype and there's so much money   coming in, and there's so much focus here, it's improving the   ecosystem at a really quick rate, and there will be value   made from that.   Kretzmann:    I think, as investors today, if someone really wants to   scratch that itch, I could understand putting 1% or less of your   net worth into bitcoin and ethereum, just to get some exposure   and follow along, as long as you're in a position where you   recognize there's a chance that it could go up 10 times in   value over the next year, or it could go to   zero potentially. You just have to recognize that   it's very speculative at this point.But it'll also be interesting to follow more   established companies like   Visa    ,   MasterCard    ,   PayPal    , even the exchanges like   Nasdaq    or   CBOE Holdings    or   Intercontinental Exchange    , to see how they find different ways to implement this   technology or give people access to these cryptocurrencies   that are coming out.And one quick thing on ICOs, and the reason I think right   now it's a little bubbly and speculative for my taste, even   Paris Hilton is promoting initial coin offerings right   now and cryptocurrencies. So it's me --   Greer:    And you don't trust her? You don't see her as credible?   Kretzmann:    I mean, maybe with fashion. But when it comes to   cryptocurrencies and ICOs and all this stuff, when Paris   Hilton is getting in, I wonder if maybe that's a sign   of at least a shorter-term peak.   Bush:    Yeah, I would say that if you're interested in investing in   this space, whether it's bitcoin or something else,   it's important to know what you're doing. The skill set is   different for investing in cryptocurrencies than it is in   stocks. It's a much more interdisciplinary form, I guess,   of investing in my opinion, just because you have to add the   extra layer of understanding programming and computer science. A   lot of these projects are pre-product, essentially, so you   really have to get into the code and the white papers to figure   out if there's any value there.   Greer:    Yeah, and even if you're not interested, I would say   sprinkle that acronym, ICO, throughout your   conversation, because that sounds credible.   Kretzmann:    You'll sound so smart.   Greer:    You'll impress your friends at a cocktail party.   ""Hey, can you believe what these ICOs are doing?""   Kretzmann:    And just remember to thank us when you sound super-smart at   parties.   Greer:    That's right. Someone is going to correct you like, ""Don't you   mean IPOs?"" And you'll be like, ""No, I mean initial coin   offering. What part of that do you not understand? Come   on!""   Bush:    ""It's 2017!"" [laughs]   Kretzmann:    ""I listen to   Market Foolery    !"" [laughs]          Aaron Bush      owns shares of Amazon, Intercontinental Exchange, MasterCard,     and PayPal Holdings.

2016-09-29,How Would An Interest Rate Hike Impact CME's Interest Rate Derivatives Trading?,"How Have Rates Affected Trading Volumes? With improving macroeconomic conditions, it was initially expected that the Fed would increase interest rates (which had been around zero since 2008) in 2014. However, in spite of the unemployment rate going down, the hike did not happen throughout the year. This caused volatility in the derivative market to rise, consequently increasing interest rate derivative trading volumes. With the dollar strengthening and inflation at an all-time low of under 2% in 2015 and still no rate hikes, investors appeared to lose interest in the segment and trading volumes declined.    A 25 basis point interest rate hike in December 2015 attracted a surge in trading volumes during the first two months of 2016. However, a slowdown in the Chinese economy likely weighed on trading volumes, leading to a decline in trading volumes post-February 2016. The Brexit vote caused a slight increase in trading activity during May and June, but the volatility caused by the news was short-lived, and July and August again saw a dip in volumes.With subdued global economic growth and macroeconomic uncertainty expected to prevail in the near term, the next probable rate hike is expected in early 2017. Accordingly, we expect interest rate derivative trading volumes to remain suppressed for the rest of the year.See    the full Trefis analysis for CME Group.

2017-05-03,A Drop in Trading Volume Curbs Nasdaq's Results,"Positive revenue and profit growth for   Nasdaq Inc.    (NASDAQ: NDAQ)  in the first quarter of 2017 was somewhat   dampened by weaker transaction volume in the company's trading   markets. Nasdaq's earnings report, released on April 26,   demonstrates that trading volume still plays a significant role   in the exchange operator's financial model. But it also reveals   the effectiveness of Nasdaq's recent efforts to diversify its   revenue streams. We'll dive into the quarter's details after a   run through key earnings metrics below.Data source: Nasdaq.           Image source: Getty Images.While Nasdaq has utilized bolt-on acquisitions to remain   competitive with other exchanges and financial service providers,   it appears to be broadening its approach.A week before earnings, the company announced the launch of a   new quasi venture capital arm, Nasdaq Ventures, which will   partner with and invest in emerging financial technology   (fintech) companies.During Nasdaq's earnings conference call on April 26, CEO   Adena Friedman provided some color on the purpose of the new   fund: ""A key focus for me is not only to the new technologies   themselves, but how we can better apply them to accelerate our   pipeline of new commercially viable products that add greater   value to our clients. ... [W]e see Nasdaq Ventures as an avenue   for us to discover, partner and invest in emerging companies in   the fintech space that are developing and leveraging   groundbreaking technologies that align to our clients' needs,   including, but not limited to, machine intelligence, blockchain,   and the cloud.""Potentially, Nasdaq Ventures will make the overall entity's   future acquisitions much more efficient. By taking minority   stakes in fintech start-ups early on, Nasdaq will be able to   guide the development of services which directly benefit its own   client base. And it can be more selective in choosing which   companies to eventually buy outright.The first three months of 2017 validated Nasdaq's buying spree   over the last several business quarters. In a weak trading   quarter, the company was still able to post a 9% gain in   revenue.Nasdaq has for some time wanted to decrease its reliance on   trading revenue, as transaction activity within cash,   derivatives, equity, and commodity markets can be quite   cyclical. The expanding NFX platform provides evidence that   trading remains a revenue priority. But Friedman's comments above   indicate that Nasdaq will continue to diversify its business   model in 2017, and likely for a few years to follow, as well.          10 stocks we like better than Nasdaq            When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

2017-09-07,CME Group Makes Clean Sweep With Solid Average Daily Volume,"Shares of CME Group Inc  . CME  gained 2.4% in the last trading session after it reported average daily volume (ADV) for August. ADV of 16 million contracts per day improved 16% year over year. Of this, Options volume surged 30% year over year to average 3.1 million contracts per day, while electronic options soared 51% year over year and averaged 2.2 million contracts per day. The company witnessed increase in ADV in all six product lines.        CME Group's improving volumes are driven by a solid operating leverage, helping it maintain an enormous market share. The company holds about 90% market share of the global futures trading and clearing services. Expansion of futures products in emerging markets, plus increase in non-transaction related opportunities and OTC offerings should continue to contribute modestly to the top-line growth in years ahead. Efforts to expand and cross-sell through strategic alliances, acquisitions, new product initiatives as well as global presence should also drive growth.

The Philadelphia Housing Sector Index also was more than 0.6% lower in recent trading.In economic news:New trade worries sent U.S. stocks reeling again today, after Canada Sunday began $13 billion in retalitory tariffs on selected American products in response to U.S. tariffs on imported steel from Canada. Mexico also plans to impose a 20% duty on pork starting Thursday while China is expected to raise the price of pork arriving into the company in addition to a 25% tariff on U.S. soybeans beginning on Friday. The Financial Times, citing a letter sent the U.S. Commerce Department, Monday reported the European Commission is preparing another $300 million in tariffs on U.S. goods if the Trump White House moves ahead with its threatened tariffs on EU auto imports. U.S. President Donald Trump, meanwhile, told Fox News on Sunday that his tariffs on steel and aluminum imports were ""just the warm-up act"" and according to a draft document leaked to Axios, the administration also is looking at leaving the World Trade Organization in order to sidestep WTO limits on import tariffs.A pair of manufacturing reports Monday provided somewhat conflicting takes on the U.S. manufacturing sector last month. The purchasing managers index reported a better-than-expected 55.4 reading for June, topping consensus opinion in an Econoday survey expecting no movement from the mid-month 54.6 flash reading although the overall number still was down a full point from May's 56.4 reading.

Year-over-year, residential construction spending was up 4.5% over June 2017, dropping from a downwardly revised 5.0% increase in May.Among financial stocks moving on news:+ The Blackstone Group ( BX  ) was almost 3% higher in late Monday trading, staying within close range of its session high, after the investment manager announced its purchase of Averys from Equistone Partners Europe. Terms of the transaction for the privately held European manufacturer of customized racking and storage equipment at warehouses were not disclosed. A Q3 closing is expected, subject to customary closing conditions.In other sector news:+ Boardwalk Pipeline Partners LP ( BWP  ) climbed as much as 4% on Monday after late Friday saying its general partner has exercised it right to acquire the rest of Boardwalk Pipeline Partners it doesn't already own. Under terms of the proposed transaction, Boardwalk GP will pay about $1.5 billion overall, or $12.06 per unit, representing a 3.8% premium over Boardwalk Pipeline's closing price on Friday.+ Nasdaq ( NDAQ  ) was little changed Monday afternoon, swinging between small gains and losses after saying it signed a deal to provide clearing and settlement technology to the National Stock Exchange of India. In addition to providing technology replacing NSE's existing clearing and settlement systems, Nasdaq will provide risk management tools to the new client while the companies also plan to explore potential cross listings, market data and other corporate business opportunities.- Orix Corp ( IX  ) dropped almost 1% at one point during Monday trading after Sunday saying its U.S. unit is acquiring privately-held NXT Capital for an undisclosed amount.

2016-10-21,3 Ways to Trade the Stock Exchanges (NDAQ CBOE CME),"InvestorPlace    InvestorPlace   - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips As traders, we know who the national stock exchanges are. As middlemen, they allow us the opportunity to invest or speculate in publicly traded companies and other asset classes. Right now though, Nasdaq   Inc  (NASDAQ:    NDAQ   ), CBOE Holdings, Inc  (NASDAQ:    CBOE   ) and CME Group Inc  (NASDAQ:    CME   ) are setting up as various investments in their own right.If you're like me, the stock exchanges are typically an afterthought, if anything at all when it comes to your investment strategies. That is, unless you happen to be a high frequency trader.It should be remembered though, stock exchanges are businesses with the same prospects and concerns of any asset listed within the confines of each one's walls - whether that's a relic-like, physical trading floor or a boatload of servers set up in a remote facility more secure than Fort Knox.More to the point, whether you're a long-term investor, swing trader or a rarer and less frenetic (these days) daytrader - NDAQ, CBOE and CME can be easily bought or shorted and/or positioned with calls and puts.Let's take a closer look, both on and off the price charts at NDAQ, CBOE and CME and see what investment and or trading opportunities exist right now in each of these stock exchanges.       Click to Enlarge   If you're a relic like me, who did actually trade on two of the country's stock exchanges ""way"" back in the day, you'll know that Nasdaq is remembered as the first-mover in electronic trading. In fact, on the Nasdaq, there never was an actual trading floor where market makers or specialists could physically congregate.This stock exchange was also associated as a pioneer by listing high-flying and then unknown tech companies like Microsoft Corporation  (NASDAQ:    MSFT   ) or Apple Inc.  (NASDAQ:    AAPL   ) while investors were still calling in their buy and sell orders from a telephone to their broker's answering machine.Now, however, it's time to hit the ""buy"" key in NDAQ shares using your mobile, iPad or Surface Pro. Nasdaq looks great as a pullback opportunity within a favorable uptrend on the weekly price chart.Sure, this stock exchange has enjoyed a nice run the last couple years and may not have found technical support just yet, but as they say, ""the trend is your friend."" Such trends can last longer than investors think possible.Checking the options board and mindful of an imminent earnings release for NDAQ, I like the Dec $62.50 married put for $66.70. The long stock, long put position offers guaranteed protection at $62.50 from the purchased put. We chose this strike as it's near key chart support in NDAQ.Importantly, this NDAQ spread also keeps the max risk exposure to 6% for the next couple months and maintains an open profit profile on the upside if the stock exchange's uptrend reasserts itself. The CBOE is actually known as an options market operator and not a stock exchange. However, that could be close to changing.      Click to Enlarge   CBOE is looking to acquire electronic exchange Bats Global Markets Inc  (BATS:    BATS   ) in a $3.2 billion deal  by next spring. According to Barron's,  a merger could provide a radical transformation  and prove a huge boon for CBOE and makes this a name to buy on any weakness.We couldn't agree more with Barron's.  As the chart suggests, that day of reckoning appears to be unfolding. Other investors have been less enthusiastic about the apparent synergies of this still pending deal and CBOE shares are currently below 200-day simple moving average and just barely breaching a long-term, trendline support.In this situation, thinking the weakness may not be over just yet, but not minding the purchase of shares at lower levels due to deal's underlying value to the CBOE franchise, the Dec $60/57.50 bull put spread is attractive.Priced at 40 cents with shares at $63.50, the trader receives the full credit as long as shares are above $60 at expiration. That allows for a decent size decline in CBOE of 5.5%. Earnings however, scheduled for next Friday could force that type of move in short order.Below the sold $60 strike the trader has the opportunity to take possession of CBOE stock through assignment and essentially become a buyer on weakness. What's more, in the event that no longer looks as appealing, risk with this spread is limited no matter what may transpire in the future.       Click to Enlarge   CME Group is our third market operator of interest. Similar to CBOE, CME handles  options trading  and isn't a stock exchange in the literal sense. CME is also a massive player in the futures markets ranging from foreign exchange, interest rates, agriculture, energy and other commodities.CME is the 800 lb. gorilla of the group with a market cap of around $36 billion versus CBOE's $5.0 billion and NASDAQ's $10.0 billion.Likewise, on the price chart following a fairly staunch year and one-half correction, CME is looking the fiercest technically of the three exchanges. Our view is the current pullback may not be fully done, but CME appears to be within a couple percent of key support that should have no problem finding buyers.Reviewing CME's options, the Dec $100/$105 bull call spread has our interest. With shares at $103.50, this spread fetches $3 mid-market.Currently, the pricing means at expiration this bullish CME trader would make 50 cents, or a return of 17%, as the spread would simply expand to $3.50. And if shares rally less than 2%, a return of nearly 70% ($2) is captured above $105 at expiration.Unlike generating income with a strategy such as a buy-write, which has a good deal of stock risk, this spread's risk is limited to the $3 paid. And given this stock exchange also reports next week that relationship is worth considering.

2018-05-10,U.S. ECONOMICS: Jobless Claims Remain Near 48-Year Lows,"Claims entered May well below the cycle-low April average of 221,000, versus prior averages of 228,000 in March, 224,000 in February, and 232,000 in January. The May Bureau of Labor Statistics survey week reading looks poised to undershoot recent survey week readings of 233,000 in April, 227,000 in March, 218,000 in February, and 226,000 in January.Analysts with Action Economics ( AE  ) peg the May nonfarm payroll gain at 195,000, which lies above the 164,000 April figure, but right between the 200,000 year-to-date average and the 190,000 average increase over the past 12 months.

2017-04-26,Nasdaq (NDAQ) Earnings: First Quarter Profit Soars 28 Percent,"It would be gross understatement to say Nasdaq (NDAQ) is having a pretty good week.A day after the Nasdaq Composite Index broke the 6,000 mark for the first time since its inception 46 years ago, the publicly-traded company on Wednesday reported a first quarter profit that rose 28%.In the three months that ended March, the New York-based company reported first-quarter earnings of $169 million, or 99 cents per share. On an adjusted basis, when taking out one-time gains and costs, earnings came to $1.10 per share, or 4 cent higher than analysts were expecting. This period marks Nasdaq's 12th earnings beat in fourteen quarters.The company initiatives to grow profit margins continue to bear fruit. At the same time, strategic acquisitions, including Canadian stock trading venue CXC and options exchange operator International Securities Exchange, were aimed at strengthening the platform are paying early dividends. Those acquisitions contributed to some $50 million positive revenue impact during the quarter, helping Nasdaq to post first quarter revenue of $971 million.The company's adjusted revenue came to $583 million, which rose 9% year over year. Revenue from market services, the company's largest segment, rose 8.5% year over year to $218 million, while corporate services revenue roses almost 12% year over year to $160 million. The company said it achieved $50 million in annualized run-rate cost synergies out of the $60 million its expected. And it did so within eighteen months of some of the aforementioned 2016 acquisition closing dates.""I'm pleased Nasdaq was able to set new highs in terms of operating income and EPS, and deliver continued strong organic revenue growth across the non-transactional businesses, despite a challenging trading volume environment,"" said CEO Adena Friedman in a statement. ""Importantly, we are seeing growth in areas where we've invested materially to innovate for the benefit of our clients, bringing them new or enhanced capabilities and efficiencies, in particular in the Market Technology, Information Services and Corporate Solutions businesses.""Home to some of the world's largest tech stocks and most-profitable names such as Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), and Alphabet (GOOGL), Nasdaq, which also handles more initial public offerings (IPOs) than its peers, is in good company.Looking ahead, the company expects the top end of its 2017 adjusted operating expenses to be about $1.30 billion, lowering it from its prior forecast of $1.31 billion, while keeping the low end unchanged at $1.26 billion. This further underscores the focus the management continues to place in profitability.Nasdaq shares have climbed 5% year to date and roughly 10% in the last 12 months. And with the company announcing a 19% boost in its quarterly dividend to 38 cents, combined with actively buying back stock (bought back $156 million of its stock in Q1), Nasdaq shares -- despite trading near 52-week highs -- could be on the verge of its own milestone.

2018-04-24,Hartford Financial (HIG) Q1 Earnings: What's in the Offing?,"The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc.  HIG  will release first-quarter 2018 financial results on Apr 26, after the closing bell.Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 9.46%.  Let's see, how things are shaping up for this announcement.   Q1 Expectations Hartford Financial's Commercial Lines and Personal Auto businesses have been delivering strong results over the past many quarters. The company also expects a solid performance from the Commercial Lines in small and middle markets. Notably, these two segments have contributed substantially to the company's top-line appreciation.Moreover, the company's Group Benefit and Mutual Funds segments are likely to have delivered robust results ,  reflecting the company's claims of improvements made in its book of business over the years.Additionally, the company's strategic investment in products, distribution, data and analytics as well as digital capabilities, aimed at customer acquisition and retention, are estimated to boost revenue growth.Hartford Financial has also been enhancing shareholders value through frequent share repurchases, which might improve the bottom line in the first quarter, limiting the outstanding share count.However, higher auto loss costs are anticipated to have affected the underwriting margins, repeating the trend from the previous quarters.   Earnings Whispers Our proven model does not conclusively show that Hartford Financial is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP  and a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. But that is not the case here as you will see below. Zacks ESP  : Hartford Financial has an Earnings ESP of -1.29%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they're reported with our Earnings ESP Filter  .   The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc. Price and EPS   Surprise                   The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc. Price   and EPS Surprise    |      The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc. Quote     Zacks Rank  : Hartford Financial carries a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, a company needs to have a positive ESP to be confident about an earnings surprise. Thus, this combination leaves surprise prediction inconclusive. We caution against Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.   Stocks to Consider Here are a few companies from the Finance sector that you may want to consider as these have the right combination of elements to  surpass estimates this time around:   Nasdaq, Inc. NDAQ  has an Earnings ESP of +0.31% and a Zacks Rank of 3. The company is set to report first-quarter earnings on Apr 25.     ConnectOne Bancorp, Inc. CNOB  has an Earnings ESP of +2.86% and is a Zacks #3 Ranked player. The company is set to report first-quarter earnings on Apr 25.     Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?      Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers. Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge.   With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply, one company stands out as the #1 stock to buy according to Zacks research.   It's not the one you think.

2018-05-23,Nasdaq Scales 52-Week High: Can it Sustain the Bull Run?,"Shares of Nasdaq Inc  . NDAQ  hit a new 52-week high of $91.94 on May 22, banking on solid April volumes as well as strong first-quarter results.  With about 0.9 million shares traded in the last session, the stock closed at $91.51, gaining 0.3%.      Strong April Volumes      Nasdaq posted improved volumes for April. While U.S. equity options volume expanded 22.1% year over year to 138 million contracts, European options and futures volumes were 7.7 million contracts in the month, up 30.5% year over year.     What Should Help the Stock Keep the Price Momentum Alive?      As a part of its growth strategy, Nasdaq intensified its focus on Market Technology and Information Services businesses, offering biggest growth opportunities. It also  emphasizes core special marketplace platform businesses. Nasdaq intends to lower its capital resources for investment in business, failing to offer considerable growth for the company.     Nasdaq's growth has also been driven by its initiatives to accelerate a non-transaction revenue base including market technology, listing and information revenues. Management estimates medium-term outlook of 8-11% growth.     For 2018, Nasdaq projects non-GAAP operating expense in the range of $1.295-$1.335 billion, down from the earlier guided range of $1.375-$1.415 billion. This primarily reflects the closing of the divestitures of the Public Relations Solutions and Digital Media Services businesses in April. Lower expense will likely aid margin expansion.     Nasdaq boasts a healthy balance sheet and a solid cash position along with modest operating cash flow from its diverse business model. This in turn helps the company to engage in effective capital deployment. While Nasdaq has a $627 million share buyback program under its authorization, its five-year dividend growth rate of 38.7% is better than the industry average of 19.5%.     The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 reflects a 20.7% increase on 5.1% higher revenues. The consensus mark for revenues and earnings per share in 2019 translates into a year-over-year improvement of 9.2 % and 3.6%, respectively.     Over the last 30 days, the consensus estimate has moved north by 1.4% for 2018 and 0.9% for 2019 as most analysts have raised their estimates.     Stocks to Consider      Some better-ranked stocks from the finance sector are CME Group CME  , The Navigators Group, Inc. NAVG  and The Progressive Corporation PGR  , each carrying Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see    the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy)   stocks here   .     CME Group operates contract markets for the trading of futures and options on futures contracts worldwide. It pulled off an average four-quarter positive surprise of 1.86%.     Navigators Group underwrites marine, property and casualty plus professional liability insurance products and services in the United States and worldwide. The company came up with positive earnings surprises in three of the trailing four quarters, with an average beat of 14.66%.       Progressive Corporation provides personal and commercial auto insurance, residential property insurance and other specialty property-casualty insurance and related services, primarily in the United States. The company pulled off positive surprises in three of the last four quarters, with an average beat of 6.23%.       The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of All      Last year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion.

2018-06-26,EU signals no easing up on financial market access after Brexit,"By Huw JonesLONDON, June 26 (Reuters) - The European Union's default market access for foreign financial firms will not be eased for Britain after Brexit and improvements to the equivalence regime will apply to all third countries, an EU official told Reuters.The official's comments raise the prospect that banks and insurers in the City of London financial district will at best face restricted cross-border trade with the bloc after Britain leaves the EU.This leaves Britain with the bloc's ""off the shelf"" system of direct market access -- known as equivalence -- as the probable if imperfect bet, EU officials have said. It refers to Brussels granting access if it decides that the home rules of a foreign firm offer protection for EU investors to the same extent as the bloc's own rules. It means a foreign firm can avoid the cost of setting up a subsidiary in the EU.EU leaders said in March that Britain could be offered an improved version of equivalence, raising hopes of a more accommodative system for financial firms in London.But a senior European Commission official said the improvements Brussels has in mind are already being made.""Our legislation is already fit for the purposes of equivalence,"" the official said, on condition of anonymity.""We have globally the most open rules for recognising third country regimes, but we are looking, case by case as we review legislation, if changes are necessary.""The reforms so far tighten rather than ease requirements as Brussels races to adapt equivalence to cope with a huge foreign financial centre that will soon be on its doorstep.It has proposed tougher oversight of major foreign clearing houses that handle big trades for EU customers, which will affect LCH, a unit of the London Stock Exchange.There will also be more stringent requirements for foreign investment banks, many of which are in London.""From our perspective at the current stage, those are the essential changes that need to be made,"" the official said.UK-based financial firms are opening hubs in the EU to cope with the uncertainty about what any Brexit deal will look like. ""RULE TAKER""Equivalence has been granted in over 100 cases to financial firms in Japan, Singapore, the United States and elsewhere.But Britain's government and its main financial trade bodies reject the scheme, saying it does not cover all financial activities, the process is politicised, and access can be revoked at short notice.It would turn Britain into a ""rule taker"" that must copy EU rules, like Norway or Switzerland, they say.Britain's finance minister Philip Hammond said last week that changes to equivalence proposed so far were more about forcing business to move to the EU, rather than making a one-sided system acceptable.While UK regulators say all is still to play for in trade negotiations, Brussels is sticking to its guns.""It's true that equivalence, like with substituted compliance in the U.S., is a discretionary decision that ... can also be revoked,"" the Commission official said.""That is something that goes with the nature of equivalence and that is something that we don't intend to change, and would be legally difficult to change,"" the official added. U.S. WORRIESU.S. regulators say the planned changes to equivalence could be a taste of what's to come for everyone.""The EU's approach to foreign clearing houses is likely to be a framework that other areas of EU financial regulation will follow,"" Eric Pan, director of international affairs at the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission, told Reuters.""It represents an evolution in thinking in the EU to expand EU control over firms providing financial services outside of the EU, creating potential conflict with foreign regulators.""This contrasts with the U.S. approach of so-called deference, or relying on a firm's home regulator, he said.""The clearing house proposal is testing the ground for an extra-territorial approach in supervision,"" Pan said.Brussels replies that the CFTC has oversight of LCH's dollar-denominated clearing operations in London and the EU just wants the same."

2018-07-11,UK shifts Brexit focus for financial services sector -FT,"LONDON, July 11 (Reuters) - Britain has given up trying to keep full access to the European Union market for its giant financial services sector after Brexit and instead will push for an easing of existing rules, the Financial Times reported.Prime Minister Theresa May's latest plans for Brexit, which will be published in detail on Thursday, show that London will seek a looser partnership with the EU in the financial services sector than its current ties, the newspaper said.Institutions in the City of London have already scaled back their expectations of continued full access to the EU after a Brexit transition period ends.The FT said Britain wanted to be the country outside the bloc with the closest relationship in financial services to what will then be the EU's 27 member countries.Under the equivalence system, Brussels grants access to EU markets if it decides that the home rules of a foreign firm offer protection for EU investors to the same extent as the bloc's own rules. It means a foreign firm can avoid the cost of setting up a subsidiary in the EU.Britain's finance ministry declined to comment on the FT report, but said finance minister Philip Hammond has argued that the EU's existing equivalence system would not work for Britain.""The government is committed to agreeing a close future relationship on financial services and a bilateral solution that preserves the mutual benefits of integrated markets whilst protecting financial stability,"" the ministry said in a statement."

2016-12-20,ICE 2016 In Review: Inorganic Growth Drives An Otherwise Sluggish Year For The Exchange,"Strengthening Data Services Segment With Acquisitions Is   ICE's Current Focus With increased demand for data services and competitors like NASDAQ also cashing in on this demand, the company's acquisitions in this regard seem to be a good strategic fit. The company has witnessed double the revenue contribution from data services in the current year. With 30% attributed to organic growth, the rest has been supported by the company's acquisitions to cater to the increasing demand of data services, augmenting its existing capabilities.       We believe the company will be able to expand the markets served by the company, add technology platforms and increase risk management, new data and valuation services. This is likely to propel further growth in this segment in future.   Trading Volumes Show Slight Improvement Due To Various   Product Offerings Energy derivatives volumes have gone up this year owing to the oil-price rally from OPEC's decision to limit supply after an extended period of excess supply and weak pricing. Even metals continued to be in high demand as a safe investment product for investors amid uncertain macro conditions. Interest rate derivatives did well during the first half of the year, potentially due to the increased volatility from the Fed's interest rate hike towards the end of 2015. However, the third quarter saw a dip in volumes. We expect the volumes to rise with the Fed's  and planned hikes. The recently concluded U.S. presidential election is likely to add volatility to the market, which could lead to an increase in trading volumes across all product lines.Please refer to    the full Trefis analysis for Intercontinental   Exchange.

2016-10-27,"Nasdaq Inc. Sees Rising Revenue, and Rising Costs, From Recent Acquisitions","Image source: Getty Images.   Nasdaq Inc.    (NASDAQ: NDAQ) released third-quarter 2016 results on Oct. 26,   and for those who follow the global exchange closely,   similarities to the previous sequential quarter were quite   evident. Short-term costs from a host of recent acquisitions   again partially offset revenue gains from the purchases. Before   delving into these and other details, let's first review a   high-level financial summary of the last three months:                       Data source: Nasdaq Inc. 8-K filing, Oct. 26, 2016. YOY = Year   over year.One of Nasdaq's strategic imperatives has been the   diversification of revenue, as the company seeks to supplement   trading income with a number of other top-line enhancements.   During the company's third-quarter earnings conference call, CEO   Bob Greifeld drew a direct correlation between the company's   acquisition strategy and its recent revenue transformation:Just to highlight for everyone on this call, again regarding     the significance that our model plays in our results, post the     ISE acquisition, over 75% of our net revenues during the third     quarter of 2016 came from subscription and recurring revenues,     a record $441 million, quite a remarkable testament to the     evolution of this franchise.During the quarter we saw 5% organic net revenue growth     across the non-trading segments, which provide the vast     majority of the subscription and recurring revenues, with the     biggest contribution to our growth coming from the Technology     Solutions segment, with 10% organic growth, truly outstanding.     In addition to strong organic growth progress, we also     continued to successfully integrate the four acquisitions made     in 2016, which are right down the center of our bowling alley.     We've already begun to deliver significant accretion to our     shareholders from these acquisitions.     Greifeld's point that acquisitions have shifted Nasdaq's   revenue structure to a composition of more than 75% non-trading   income underscores an achievement -- as well as a reality. Below   is a graph from Nasdaq's third-quarter 2016 investor   presentation, which shows organic revenue growth trends among the   company's services:        Image source: Nasdaq, Inc. Q3 2016 investor presentation.Over the last four quarters, market services organic revenue,   which encompasses equity, cash, fixed income, and commodity   trading and clearing services, has declined 22 percentage points.   Acquisitions such as ISE have stabilized trading revenue. But   more importantly, non-trading acquisitions, bringing new and   varied services in house, point to the future of Nasdaq's revenue   and earnings. That's why shareholders can be somewhat tolerant of   lower earnings for now, while the company absorbs its   diversification purchases. The payoff, a much more balanced and   predictable revenue base, should be worth the wait.
